This git repository contains Bob Dylan songs collected by me.

I collected this songs in csv file. 

There's 344 records

Decription of dataset:

Context
This dataset contains songs from years between 1961 to 2020 written by Bob Dylan.

Content
There are 4 columns:

* release_year - year when song was released first time,
* album - name of the album where track occurs,
* title - title of the song,
* lyrics - lyrics of the track
Acknowledgements
This dataset contains only songs that Bob Dylan himself has written and published.
There's many songs that Bob Dylan only covered so I didn't include them because he's not the original author.
For instance album World Gone Wrong contains only old folks songs.

Inspiration
I'm great Bob Dylan fan. I listen to his songs almost every day from many years.
I also play them and sing them so now I decided to make dataset and play with them on kaggle as well.

Ideas:

Which word is the most frequent?
How distribution of Dylan's songs changed over the years?
Is Dylan songs mostly positive, negative or neutral?


I also made a wordclouds for all albums, tites and lyric using wordcloud module, link to documentation:
