1961,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Hard Times In New York Town,"come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song

sing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong

just a little glimpse of a story i’ll tell

’bout an east coast city that you all know well

it’s hard times in the city

livin’ down in new york town



old new york city is a friendly old town

from washington heights to harlem on down

there’s a-mighty many people all millin’ all around

they’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down

it’s hard times in the city

livin’ down in new york town



it’s a mighty long ways from the golden gate

to rockefeller plaza ’n’ the empire state.

mister rockefeller sets up as high as a bird

old mister empire never says a word

it’s hard times from the country

livin’ down in new york town



well, it’s up in the mornin’ tryin’ to find a job of work

stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt

if you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry

if you only got a nickel, it’s the staten island ferry

and it’s hard times in the city

livin’ down in new york town



mister hudson come a-sailin’ down the stream

and old mister minuet paid for his dream

bought your city on a one-way track

’f i had my way i’d sell it right back

and it’s hard times in the city

livin’ down in new york town



i’ll take all the smog in cal-i-for-ne-ay

’n’ every bit of dust in the oklahoma plains

’n’ the dirt in the caves of the rocky mountain mines

it’s all much cleaner than the new york kind

and it’s hard times in the city

livin’ down in new york town



so all you newsy people, spread the news around

you c’n listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song

you c’n step on my name, you c’n try ’n’ get me beat

when i leave new york, i’ll be standin’ on my feet

and it’s hard times in the city

livin’ down in new york town"
1961,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Man on the street,"’ll sing you a song, ain’t very long

’bout an old man who never done wrong

how he died nobody can say

they found him dead in the street one day



well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn

at the man whose clothes ’n’ shoes were torn

there on the sidewalk he did lay

they stopped ’n’ stared ’n’ walked their way



well, the p’liceman come and he looked around

“get up, old man, or i’m a-takin’ you down”

he jabbed him once with his billy club

and the old man then rolled off the curb



well, he jabbed him again and loudly said

“call the wagon; this man is dead”

the wagon come, they loaded him in

i never saw the man again



i’ve sung you my song, it ain’t very long

’bout an old man who never done wrong

how he died no one can say

they found him dead in the street one day"
1962,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Talkin’ Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,"i saw it advertised one day

bear mountain picnic was comin’ my way

“come along ’n’ take a trip

we’ll bring you up there on a ship

bring the wife and kids

bring the whole family”

yippee



well, i run right down ’n’ bought a ticket

to this bear mountain picnic

but little did i realize

i was in for a picnic surprise

had nothin’ to do with mountains

i didn’t even come close to a bear



took the wife ’n’ kids down to the pier

six thousand people there

everybody had a ticket for the trip

“oh well,” i said, “it’s a pretty big ship

besides, anyway, the more the merrier”



well, we all got on ’n’ what d’ya think

that big old boat started t’ sink

more people kept a-pilin’ on

that old ship was a-slowly goin’ down

funny way t’ start a picnic



well, i soon lost track of m’ kids ’n’ wife

so many people there i never saw in m’ life

that old ship sinkin’ down in the water

six thousand people tryin’ t’ kill each other

dogs a-barkin’, cats a-meowin’

women screamin’, fists a-flyin’, babies cryin’

cops a-comin’, me a-runnin’

maybe we just better call off the picnic



i got shoved down ’n’ pushed around

all i could hear there was a screamin’ sound

don’t remember one thing more

just remember wakin’ up on a little shore

head busted, stomach cracked

feet splintered, i was bald, naked . . .

quite lucky to be alive though



feelin’ like i climbed outa m’ casket

i grabbed back hold of m’ picnic basket

took the wife ’n’ kids ’n’ started home

wishin’ i’d never got up that morn



now, i don’t care just what you do

if you wanta have a picnic, that’s up t’ you

but don’t tell me about it, i don’t wanta hear it

’cause, see, i just lost all m’ picnic spirit

stay in m’ kitchen, have m’ own picnic . . .

in the bathroom



now, it don’t seem to me quite so funny

what some people are gonna do f’r money

there’s a bran’ new gimmick every day

just t’ take somebody’s money away

i think we oughta take some o’ these people

and put ’em on a boat, send ’em up to bear mountain . . .

for a picnic"
1962,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Let Me Die in My Footsteps,"i will not go down under the ground

’cause somebody tells me that death’s comin’ ’round

an’ i will not carry myself down to die

when i go to my grave my head will be high

let me die in my footsteps

before i go down under the ground



there’s been rumors of war and wars that have been

the meaning of life has been lost in the wind

and some people thinkin’ that the end is close by

’stead of learnin’ to live they are learnin’ to die

let me die in my footsteps

before i go down under the ground



i don’t know if i’m smart but i think i can see

when someone is pullin’ the wool over me

and if this war comes and death’s all around

let me die on this land ’fore i die underground

let me die in my footsteps

before i go down under the ground



there’s always been people that have to cause fear

they’ve been talking of the war now for many long years

i have read all their statements and i’ve not said a word

but now lawd god, let my poor voice be heard

let me die in my footsteps

before i go down under the ground



if i had rubies and riches and crowns

i’d buy the whole world and change things around

i’d throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea

for they are mistakes of a past history

let me die in my footsteps

before i go down under the ground



let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood

let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood

let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves

let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace

let me die in my footsteps

before i go down under the ground



go out in your country where the land meets the sun

see the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run

nevada, new mexico, arizona, idaho

let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls

and you’ll die in your footsteps

before you go down under the ground"
1962,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991","Rambling, Gambling Willie","come around you rovin’ gamblers and a story i will tell

about the greatest gambler, you all should know him well

his name was will o’conley and he gambled all his life

he had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



he gambled in the white house and in the railroad yards

wherever there was people, there was willie and his cards

he had the reputation as the gamblin’est man around

wives would keep their husbands home when willie came to town

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



sailin’ down the mississippi to a town called new orleans

they’re still talkin’ about their card game on that jackson river queen

“i’ve come to win some money,” gamblin’ willie says

when the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



up in the rocky mountains in a town called cripple creek

there was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week

nine hundred miners had laid their money down

when willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



but willie had a heart of gold and this i know is true

he supported all his children and all their mothers too

he wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore

he spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



when you played your cards with willie, you never really knew

whether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true

he won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair

the man, he left a diamond flush, willie didn’t even have a pair

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



it was late one evenin’ during a poker game

a man lost all his money, he said willie was to blame

he shot poor willie through the head, which was a tragic fate

when willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



so all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be

the moral of the story is very plain to see

make your money while you can, before you have to stop

for when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up

and it’s ride, willie, ride

roll, willie, roll

wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows"

1962,Bob Dylan,Talkin' New York,"ramblin’ outa the wild west
 
 leavin’ the towns i love the best
 
 thought i’d seen some ups and downs
 
 ’til i come into new york town
 
 people goin’ down to the ground
 
 buildings goin’ up to the sky
 
 
 
 wintertime in new york town
 
 the wind blowin’ snow around
 
 walk around with nowhere to go
 
 somebody could freeze right to the bone
 
 i froze right to the bone
 
 new york times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
 
 i didn’t feel so cold then
 
 
 
 i swung onto my old guitar
 
 grabbed hold of a subway car
 
 and after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
 
 i landed up on the downtown side
 
 greenwich village
 
 
 
 i walked down there and ended up
 
 in one of them coffee-houses on the block
 
 got on the stage to sing and play
 
 man there said, “come back some other day
 
 you sound like a hillbilly
 
 we want folk singers here”
 
 
 
 well, i got a harmonica job, begun to play
 
 blowin’ my lungs out for a dollar a day
 
 i blowed inside out and upside down
 
 the man there said he loved m’ sound
 
 he was ravin’ about how he loved m’ sound
 
 dollar a day’s worth
 
 
 
 and after weeks and weeks of hangin’ around
 
 i finally got a job in new york town
 
 in a bigger place, bigger money too
 
 even joined the union and paid m’ dues
 
 
 
 now, a very great man once said
 
 that some people rob you with a fountain pen
 
 it didn’t take too long to find out
 
 just what he was talkin’ about
 
 a lot of people don’t have much food on their table
 
 but they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
 
 and they gotta cut somethin’
 
 
 
 so one mornin’ when the sun was warm
 
 i rambled out of new york town
 
 pulled my cap down over my eyes
 
 and headed out for the western skies
 
 so long, new york
 
 howdy, east orange"
1962,Bob Dylan,Song to Woody,"i’m out here a thousand miles from my home
 
 walkin’ a road other men have gone down
 
 i’m seein’ your world of people and things
 
 your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
 
 
 
 hey, hey, woody guthrie, i wrote you a song
 
 ’bout a funny ol’ world that’s a-comin’ along
 
 seems sick an’ it’s hungry, it’s tired an’ it’s torn
 
 it looks like it’s a-dyin’ an’ it’s hardly been born
 
 
 
 hey, woody guthrie, but i know that you know
 
 all the things that i’m a-sayin’ an’ a-many times more
 
 i’m a-singin’ you the song, but i can’t sing enough
 
 ’cause there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done
 
 
 
 here’s to cisco an’ sonny an’ leadbelly too
 
 an’ to all the good people that traveled with you
 
 here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men
 
 that come with the dust and are gone with the wind
 
 
 
 i’m a-leavin’ tomorrow, but i could leave today
 
 somewhere down the road someday
 
 the very last thing that i’d want to do
 
 is to say i’ve been hittin’ some hard travelin’ too"

i didn’t know what in the world i wus gonna do

them communists they wus comin’ around

they wus in the air

they wus on the ground

they wouldn’t gimme no peace . . .



so i run down most hurriedly

and joined up with the john birch society

i got me a secret membership card

and started off a-walkin’ down the road

yee-hoo, i’m a real john bircher now

look out you commies



now we all agree with hitler’s views

although he killed six million jews

it don’t matter too much that he was a fascist

at least you can’t say he was a communist

that’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria



well, i wus lookin’ everywhere for them gol-darned reds

i got up in the mornin’ ’n’ looked under my bed

looked in the sink, behind the door

looked in the glove compartment of my car

couldn’t find ’em . . .



i wus lookin’ high an’ low for them reds everywhere

i wus lookin’ in the sink an’ underneath the chair

i looked way up my chimney hole

i even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl

they got away . . .



well, i wus sittin’ home alone an’ started to sweat

figured they wus in my t.v. set

peeked behind the picture frame

got a shock from my feet, hittin’ right up in the brain

them reds caused it

i know they did . . . them hard-core ones



well, i quit my job so i could work all alone

then i changed my name to sherlock holmes

followed some clues from my detective bag

and discovered they wus red stripes on the american flag

that ol’ betsy ross . . .



well, i investigated all the books in the library

ninety percent of ’em gotta be burned away

i investigated all the people that i knowed

ninety-eight percent of them gotta go

the other two percent are fellow birchers . . . just like me



now eisenhower, he’s a russian spy

lincoln, jefferson and that roosevelt guy

to my knowledge there’s just one man

that’s really a true american: george lincoln rockwell

i know for a fact he hates commies cus he picketed the movie exodus



well, i fin’ly started thinkin’ straight

couldn’t imagine doin’ anything else

no younger than twelve

no older ’n seventeen

thrown in like bandits

and cast off like criminals

from the dirty old mess hall

you march to the brick wall

too weary to talk

and too tired to sing

1963,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie,"when yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb

when you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb

when yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace

in a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race

no matter what yer doing if you start givin' up

if the wine don't come to the top of yer cup

if the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on

and the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone

and yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it

and the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it

and yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long

and you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong

and lonesome comes up as down goes the day

and tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away

and you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'

and yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'

and yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys

turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys

and yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'

and the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'

and the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'

and yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'

and yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm

and to yourself you sometimes say

""i never knew it was gonna be this way

why didn't they tell me the day i was born""

and you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat

and you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet

and yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air

and the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare

and yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying

and yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'

and yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet

and you need it badly but it lays on the street

and yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat

and you think yer ears might a been hurt

or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt

and you figured you failed in yesterdays rush

when you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush

and all the time you were holdin' three queens

and it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean

like in the middle of life magazine

bouncin' around a pinball machine

and there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying

that somebody someplace oughta be hearin'

but it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head

and it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed

and no matter how you try you just can't say it

and yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it

and yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head

and yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead

and the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth

and his jaws start closin with you underneath

and yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind

and you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign

and you say to yourself just what am i doin'

on this road i'm walkin', on this trail i'm turnin'

on this curve i'm hanging

on this pathway i'm strolling, in the space i'm taking

in this air i'm inhaling

am i mixed up too much, am i mixed up too hard

why am i walking, where am i running

what am i saying, what am i knowing

on this guitar i'm playing, on this banjo i'm frailin'

on this mandolin i'm strummin', in the song i'm singin'

in the tune i'm hummin', in the words i'm writin'

in the words that i'm thinkin'

in this ocean of hours i'm all the time drinkin'

who am i helping, what am i breaking

what am i giving, what am i taking

but you try with your whole soul best

never to think these thoughts and never to let

them kind of thoughts gain ground

or make yer heart pound

but then again you know why they're around

just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down

""cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping

and you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping

and you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'

and you can't remember for the best of yer thinking

if that was you in the dream that was screaming

and you know that it's something special you're needin'

and you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'

and no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding

and you need something special

yeah, you need something special all right

you need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track

to shoot you someplace and shoot you back

you need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler

that's been banging and booming and blowing forever

that knows yer troubles a hundred times over

you need a greyhound bus that don't bar no race

that won't laugh at yer looks

your voice or your face

and by any number of bets in the book

will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze

you need something to open up a new door

to show you something you seen before

but overlooked a hundred times or more

you need something to open your eyes

you need something to make it known

that it's you and no one else that owns

that spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting

that the world ain't got you beat

that it ain't got you licked

it can't get you crazy no matter how many

times you might get kicked

you need something special all right

you need something special to give you hope

but hope's just a word

that maybe you said or maybe you heard

on some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve



but that's what you need man, and you need it bad

and yer trouble is you know it too good

""cause you look an' you start getting the chills



""cause you can't find it on a dollar bill

and it ain't on macy's window sill

and it ain't on no rich kid's road map

and it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house

and it ain't made in no hollywood wheat germ

and it ain't on that dimlit stage

with that half-wit comedian on it

ranting and raving and taking yer money

and you thinks it's funny

no you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club

and it ain't in the seats of a supper club

and sure as hell you're bound to tell

that no matter how hard you rub

you just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub

no, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you

and it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you

and it ain't in no cardboard-box house

or down any movie star's blouse

and you can't find it on the golf course

and uncle remus can't tell you and neither can santa claus

and it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes

and it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons

and it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices

that come knockin' and tappin' in christmas wrappin'

sayin' ain't i pretty and ain't i cute and look at my skin

look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow

look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry

when you can't even sense if they got any insides

these people so pretty in their ribbons and bows

no you'll not now or no other day

find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥

and inside it the people made of molasses

that every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses

and it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies

who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny

who breathe and burp and bend and crack

and before you can count from one to ten

do it all over again but this time behind yer back

my friend

the ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl

and play games with each other in their sand-box world

and you can't find it either in the no-talent fools

that run around gallant

and make all rules for the ones that got talent

and it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do

and think they're foolin' you

the ones who jump on the wagon

just for a while 'cause they know it's in style

to get their kicks, get out of it quick

and make all kinds of money and chicks

and you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat

sayin', ""christ do i gotta be like that

ain't there no one here that knows where i'm at

ain't there no one here that knows how i feel

good god almighty

that stuff ain't real""



no but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race

you can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face

you gotta look some other place

and where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'

where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'

where do you look for this oil well gushin'

where do you look for this candle that's glowin'

where do you look for this hope that you know is there

and out there somewhere

and your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads

your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows

your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways

you can touch and twist

and turn two kinds of doorknobs

you can either go to the church of your choice

or you can go to brooklyn state hospital

you'll find god in the church of your choice

you'll find woody guthrie in brooklyn state hospital



and though it's only my opinion

i may be right or wrong

you'll find them both

in the grand canyon

i spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay

his face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor

and i guess he’d been there for the whole night or more



only a hobo, but one more is gone

leavin’ nobody to sing his sad song

leavin’ nobody to carry him home

only a hobo, but one more is gone



a blanket of newspaper covered his head

as the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed

one look at his face showed the hard road he’d come

and a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed



only a hobo, but one more is gone

leavin’ nobody to sing his sad song

leavin’ nobody to carry him home

only a hobo, but one more is gone



does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down

to look up on the world from a hole in the ground

to wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame

to lie in the gutter and die with no name

as she stood in the shadows

she stepped to the light

as my silver strings spun

she called with her eyes

to the tune i’s a-playin’

and i’d only begun



through a bullet of light

her face was reflectin’

the fast fading words

that rolled from my tongue

with a long-distance look

her eyes was on fire

but the song it was long

and there was more to be sung



my eyes danced a circle

across her clear outline

with her head tilted sideways

she called me again

as the tune drifted out

she breathed hard through the echo

but the song it was long

and it was far to the end



i glanced at my guitar

and played it pretendin’

that of all the eyes out there

i could see none

as her thoughts pounded hard

like the pierce of an arrow

but the song it was long

and it had to get done



as the tune finally folded

i laid down the guitar

then looked for the girl

who’d stayed for so long

but her shadow was missin’

for all of my searchin’

1963,The Freewheelin',Talkin' World War III Blues,"some time ago a crazy dream came to me
 
 i dreamt i was walkin’ into world war three
 
 i went to the doctor the very next day
 
 to see what kinda words he could say
 
 he said it was a bad dream
 
 i wouldn’t worry ’bout it none, though
 
 they were my own dreams and they’re only in my head
 
 
 
 i said, “hold it, doc, a world war passed through my brain”
 
 he said, “nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane”
 
 he grabbed my arm, i said, “ouch”
 
 as i landed on the psychiatric couch
 
 he said, “tell me about it”
 
 
 
 well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
 
 it was all over by quarter past
 
 i was down in the sewer with some little lover
 
 when i peeked out from a manhole cover
 
 wondering who turned the lights on
 
 
 
 well, i got up and walked around
 
 and up and down the lonesome town
 
 i stood a-wondering which way to go
 
 i lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road
 
 it was a normal day
 
 
 
 well, i rung the fallout shelter bell
 
 and i leaned my head and i gave a yell
 
 “give me a string bean, i’m a hungry man”
 
 a shotgun fired and away i ran
 
 i don’t blame them too much though, i know i look funny
 
 
 
 down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
 
 i seen a man
 
 i said, “howdy friend, i guess there’s just us two”
 
 he screamed a bit and away he flew
 
 thought i was a communist
 
 
 
 well, i spied a girl and before she could leave
 
 “let’s go and play adam and eve”
 
 i took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin’
 
 when she said, “hey man, you crazy or sumpin’
 
 you see what happened last time they started”
 
 
 
 well, i seen a cadillac window uptown
 
 and there was nobody aroun’
 
 i got into the driver’s seat
 
 and i drove down 42nd street
 
 in my cadillac. good car to drive after a war
 
 
 
 well, i remember seein’ some ad
 
 so i turned on my conelrad
 
 but i didn’t pay my con ed bill
 
 so the radio didn’t work so well
 
 turned on my record player—
 
 it was rock-a-day johnny singin’, “tell your ma, tell your pa
 
 our love’s a-gonna grow ooh-wah, ooh-wah”
 
 
 
 i was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blue
 
 i needed somebody to talk to
 
 so i called up the operator of time
 
 just to hear a voice of some kind
 
 “when you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
 
 she said that for over an hour
 
 and i hung up
 
 
 
 well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
 
 sayin’, “hey i’ve been havin’ the same old dreams
 
 but mine was a little different you see
 
 i dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
 
 i didn’t see you around”
 
 
 
 well, now time passed and now it seems
 
 everybody’s having them dreams
 
 everybody sees themselves
 
 walkin’ around with no one else
 
 half of the people can be part right all of the time
 
 some of the people can be all right part of the time
 
 but all of the people can’t be all right all of the time
 
 i think abraham lincoln said that
 
 “i’ll let you be in my dreams if i can be in yours”
 
 i said that"

 wants me to grow a cigar on my face

 i fell asleep for to take my rest
 
 i dreamed a dream that made me sad
 
 concerning myself and the first few friends i had
 
 
 
 with half-damp eyes i stared to the room
 
 where my friends and i spent many an afternoon
 
 where we together weathered many a storm
 
 laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn
 
 
 
 by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
 
 our words were told, our songs were sung
 
 where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfied
 
 talkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside
 
 
 
 with haunted hearts through the heat and cold
 
 we never thought we could ever get old
 
 we thought we could sit forever in fun
 
 but our chances really was a million to one
 
 
 
 as easy it was to tell black from white
 
 it was all that easy to tell wrong from right
 
 and our choices were few and the thought never hit
 
 that the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split
 
 
 
 how many a year has passed and gone
 
 and many a gamble has been lost and won
 
 and many a road taken by many a friend
 
 and each one i’ve never seen again
 
 
 
 i wish, i wish, i wish in vain
 
 that we could sit simply in that room again
 
 ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
 
 i’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that"

but they caught him and they brought him back

and they laid him down on the jailhouse ground

with an iron chain around his neck



old reilly’s daughter got a message

that her father was goin’ to hang

she rode by night and came by morning

with gold and silver in her hand



when the judge he saw reilly’s daughter

his old eyes deepened in his head

sayin’, “gold will never free your father

the price, my dear, is you instead”



“oh i’m as good as dead,” cried reilly

“it’s only you that he does crave

and my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all

get on your horse and ride away”



“oh father you will surely die

if i don’t take the chance to try

and pay the price and not take your advice

for that reason i will have to stay”



the gallows shadows shook the evening

in the night a hound dog bayed

in the night the grounds were groanin’

in the night the price was paid



the next mornin’ she had awoken

to know that the judge had never spoken

she saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’

she saw her father’s body broken



these be seven curses on a judge so cruel:

that one doctor will not save him

that two healers will not heal him

that three eyes will not see him



that four ears will not hear him

that five walls will not hide him

that six diggers will not bury him

and that seven deaths shall never kill him"

 and old men on the benches
 
 tell you now that the whole town is empty
 
 
 
 in the north end of town
 
 my own children are grown
 
 but i was raised on the other
 
 in the wee hours of youth
 
 my mother took sick
 
 and i was brought up by my brother
 
 
 
 the iron ore poured
 
 as the years passed the door
 
 the drag lines an’ the shovels they was a-humming
 
 ’til one day my brother
 
 failed to come home
 
 the same as my father before him
 
 
 
 well a long winter’s wait
 
 from the window i watched
 
 my friends they couldn’t have been kinder and my schooling was cut
 
 as i quit in the spring
 
 to marry john thomas, a miner
 
 
 
 oh the years passed again
 
 and the givin’ was good
 
 with the lunch bucket filled every season
 
 what with three babies born
 
 the work was cut down
 
 to a half a day’s shift with no reason
 
 
 
 then the shaft was soon shut
 
 and more work was cut
 
 and the fire in the air, it felt frozen
 
 ’til a man come to speak
 
 and he said in one week
 
 that number eleven was closin’
 
 
 
 they complained in the east
 
 they are paying too high
 
 they say that your ore ain’t worth digging
 
 that it’s much cheaper down
 
 in the south american towns
 
 where the miners work almost for nothing
 
 
 
 so the mining gates locked
 
 and the red iron rotted
 
 and the room smelled heavy from drinking
 
 where the sad, silent song
 
 made the hour twice as long
 
 as i waited for the sun to go sinking
 
 
 
 i lived by the window
 
 as he talked to himself
 
 this silence of tongues it was building
 
 then one morning’s wake
 
 the bed it was bare
 
 and i’s left alone with three children

 to hide ’neath the hood
 
 to kill with no pain

 tolling for the outcast, burnin’ constantly at stake
 
 an’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
 
 the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
 
 that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
 
 leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
 
 striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
 
 striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
 
 an’ the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time
 
 an’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
 
 for the disrobed faceless forms of no position
 
 tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
 
 all down in taken-for-granted situations
 
 tolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the mute
 
 tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
 
 for the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuit
 
 an’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
 
 an’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
 
 electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
 
 condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
 
 tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
 
 for the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
 
 an’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
 
 an’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 starry-eyed an’ laughing as i recall when we were caught
 
 trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
 
 as we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last look
 
 spellbound an’ swallowed ’til the tolling ended
 
 tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
 
 for the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worse
 
 an’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
 
 an’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing"
1964,The Times They Are A-Changin',Restless Farewell,"oh all the money that in my whole life i did spend
 
 be it mine right or wrongfully
 
 i let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
 
 to tie up the time most forcefully
 
 but the bottles are done
 
 we’ve killed each one
 
 and the table’s full and overflowed
 
 and the corner sign
 
 says it’s closing time
 
 so i’ll bid farewell and be down the road

 i did not do it harmfully
 
 and ev’ry girl that ever i’ve hurt
 
 i did not do it knowin’ly

 and make amends
 
 you need the time and stay behind
 
 and since my feet are now fast
 
 and point away from the past
 
 i’ll bid farewell and be down the line
 
 
 
 oh ev’ry foe that ever i faced
 
 the cause was there before we came
 
 and ev’ry cause that ever i fought
 
 i fought it full without regret or shame
 
 but the dark does die
 
 as the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
 
 must meet the dawn
 
 and if i see the day
 
 i’d only have to stay
 
 so i’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone
 
 
 
 oh, ev’ry thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
 
 i might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
 
 but it’s not to stand naked under unknowin’ eyes
 
 it’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
 
 but the time ain’t tall, yet on time you depend
 
 and no word is possessed by no special friend
 
 and though the line is cut
 
 it ain’t quite the end
 
 i’ll just bid farewell till we meet again
 
 
 
 oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
 
 to disgrace, distract, and bother me
 
 and the dirt of gossip blows into my face
 
 and the dust of rumors covers me
 
 but if the arrow is straight
 
 and the point is slick
 
 it can pierce through dust no matter how thick
 
 so i’ll make my stand
 
 and remain as i am
 
 and bid farewell and not give a damn"

1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,Ballad in Plain D,"i once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
 
 with the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
 
 i courted her proudly but now she is gone
 
 gone as the season she’s taken
 
 
 
 through young summer’s breeze, i stole her away
 
 from her mother and sister, though close did they stay
 
 each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
 
 with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us
 
 
 
 of the two sisters, i loved the young
 
 with sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
 
 the constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
 
 by the jealousy of others around her
 
 
 
 for her parasite sister, i had no respect
 
 bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
 
 countless visions of the other she’d reflect
 
 as a crutch for her scenes and her society
 
 
 
 myself, for what i did, i cannot be excused
 
 the changes i was going through can’t even be used
 
 for the lies that i told her in hopes not to lose
 
 the could-be dream-lover of my lifetime
 
 
 
 with unknown consciousness, i possessed in my grip
 
 a magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
 
 noticing not that i’d already slipped
 
 to a sin of love’s false security
 
 
 
 from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
 
 answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
 
 till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “please
 
 what’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter”
 
 
 
 and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
 
 the timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream
 
 at the peak of the night, the king and the queen
 
 tumbled all down into pieces
 
 
 
 “the tragic figure” her sister did shout
 
 “leave her alone, god damn you, get out”
 
 and i in my armor, turning about
 
 and nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness
 
 
 
 beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound
 
 her sister and i in a screaming battleground
 
 and she in between, the victim of sound
 
 soon shattered as a child ’neath her shadows
 
 
 
 all is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
 
 i gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight
 
 my mind it was mangled, i ran into the night
 
 leaving all of love’s ashes behind me
 
 
 
 the wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
 
 the words to say i’m sorry, i haven’t found yet
 
 i think of her often and hope whoever she’s met
 
 will be fully aware of how precious she is
 
 
 
 ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
 
 “how good, how good does it feel to be free”
 
 and i answer them most mysteriously
 
 “are birds free from the chains of the skyway”"
1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free No. 10,"i’m just average, common too
 
 i’m just like him, the same as you

 it’s just the same as talking to you
 
 
 
 i was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
 
 i figured i was ready for cassius clay

 the streets in heaven are lined with gold
 
 i ask you how things could get much worse
 
 if the russians happen to get up there first
 
 wowee pretty scary
 
 
 
 now, i’m liberal, but to a degree
 
 i want ev’rybody to be free
 
 but if you think that i’ll let barry goldwater
 
 move in next door and marry my daughter
 
 you must think i’m crazy
 
 i wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in cuba
 
 
 
 well, i set my monkey on the log
 
 and ordered him to do the dog
 
 he wagged his tail and shook his head
 
 and he went and did the cat instead
 
 he’s a weird monkey, very funky
 
 
 
 i sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
 
 waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
 
 i had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
 
 and my wig-hat was falling in my face
 
 but they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court
 
 
 
 i got a woman, she’s so mean
 
 she sticks my boots in the washing machine
 
 sticks me with buckshot when i’m nude
 
 puts bubblegum in my food
 
 she’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”
 
 
 
 now i got a friend who spends his life
 
 stabbing my picture with a bowie knife
 
 dreams of strangling me with a scarf
 
 when my name comes up he pretends to barf
 
 i’ve got a million friends
 
 
 
 now they asked me to read a poem
 
 at the sorority sisters’ home
 
 i got knocked down and my head was swimmin’
 
 i wound up with the dean of women
 
 yippee i’m a poet, and i know it
 
 hope i don’t blow it
 
 
 
 i’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
 
 so i look like a walking mountain range
 
 and i’m gonna ride into omaha on a horse
 
 out to the country club and the golf course

 just what this song is all about

 you know you got
 
 nothing to win and nothing to lose

 they would turn into a meaningless ring
 
 for deep in my heart

1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,Motorpsycho Nightmare,"i pounded on a farmhouse
 
 lookin’ for a place to stay
 
 i was mighty, mighty tired
 
 i had come a long, long way
 
 i said, “hey, hey, in there
 
 is there anybody home”
 
 i was standin’ on the steps
 
 feelin’ most alone
 
 well, out comes a farmer
 
 he must have thought that i was nuts
 
 he immediately looked at me
 
 and stuck a gun into my guts
 
 
 
 i fell down
 
 to my bended knees
 
 saying, “i dig farmers
 
 don’t shoot me, please”
 
 he cocked his rifle
 
 and began to shout
 
 “you’re that travelin’ salesman
 
 that i have heard about”
 
 i said, “no no no
 
 i’m a doctor and it’s true
 
 i’m a clean-cut kid
 
 and i been to college, too”
 
 
 
 then in comes his daughter
 
 whose name was rita
 
 she looked like she stepped out of
 
 la dolce vita
 
 i immediately tried to cool it
 
 with her dad
 
 and told him what a
 
 nice, pretty farm he had
 
 he said, “what do doctors
 
 know about farms, pray tell”
 
 i said, “i was born
 
 at the bottom of a wishing well”
 
 
 
 well, by the dirt ’neath my nails
 
 i guess he knew i wouldn’t lie
 
 “i guess you’re tired”
 
 he said, kinda sly
 
 i said, “yes, ten thousand miles
 
 today i drove”
 
 he said, “i got a bed for you
 
 underneath the stove
 
 just one condition
 
 and you go to sleep right now
 
 that you don’t touch my daughter
 
 and in the morning, milk the cow”
 
 
 
 i was sleepin’ like a rat
 
 when i heard something jerkin’
 
 there stood rita
 
 lookin’ just like tony perkins
 
 she said, “would you like to take a shower
 
 i’ll show you up to the door”
 
 i said, “oh, no no
 
 i’ve been through this before”
 
 i knew i had to split
 
 but i didn’t know how
 
 when she said
 
 “would you like to take that shower, now”
 
 
 
 well, i couldn’t leave
 
 unless the old man chased me out
 
 ’cause i’d already promised
 
 that i’d milk his cows
 
 i had to say something
 
 to strike him very weird
 
 so i yelled out
 
 “i like fidel castro and his beard”
 
 rita looked offended
 
 but she got out of the way
 
 as he came charging down the stairs
 
 sayin’, “what’s that i heard you say”
 
 
 
 i said, “i like fidel castro
 
 i think you heard me right”
 
 and ducked as he swung
 
 at me with all his might
 
 rita mumbled something
 
 ’bout her mother on the hill
 
 as his fist hit the icebox
 
 he said he’s going to kill me
 
 if i don’t get out the door
 
 in two seconds flat
 
 “you unpatriotic
 
 rotten doctor commie rat”
 
 
 
 well, he threw a reader’s digest
 
 at my head and i did run
 
 i did a somersault
 
 as i seen him get his gun
 
 and crashed through the window
 
 at a hundred miles an hour
 
 and landed fully blast
 
 in his garden flowers
 
 rita said, “come back”
 
 as he started to load
 
 the sun was comin’ up
 
 and i was runnin’ down the road
 
 
 
 well, i don’t figure i’ll be back
 
 there for a spell
 
 even though rita moved away
 
 and got a job in a motel
 
 he still waits for me
 
 constant, on the sly
 
 he wants to turn me in

 she knows too much to argue or to judge

 expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

the triangle tingles

and the trumpets play slow

farewell angelina

there’s no need for blame

there’s nothing to prove

ev’rything’s still the same

just a table standing empty

by the edge of the sea

the jacks and the queens

have forsaked the courtyard

fifty-two gypsies

now file past the guards

in the space where the deuce

and the ace once ran wild

farewell angelina

the sky is folding

i’ll see you in a while



see the cross-eyed pirates sitting

perched in the sun

shooting tin cans

with a sawed-off shotgun

and the neighbors they clap

and they cheer with each blast

farewell angelina

the sky’s changing color

and i must leave fast



king kong, little elves

on the rooftops they dance

valentino-type tangos

while the makeup man’s hands

shut the eyes of the dead

not to embarrass anyone

farewell angelina

the sky is embarrassed

and i must be gone



the machine guns are roaring

the puppets heave rocks

the fiends nail time bombs

to the hands of the clocks

call me any name you like

i will never deny it

i must go where it’s quiet"

 a bed that is never mine
 
 as friends and other strangers
 
 from their fates try to resign
 
 leaving men wholly, totally free
 
 to do anything they wish to do but die
 
 and there are no trials inside the gates of eden
 
 
 
 at dawn my lover comes to me
 
 and tells me of her dreams

1965,Highway 61 Revisited,Like a Rolling Stone,"once upon a time you dressed so fine
 
 you threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you
 
 people’d call, say, “beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
 
 you thought they were all kiddin’ you
 
 you used to laugh about
 
 everybody that was hangin’ out
 
 now you don’t talk so loud
 
 now you don’t seem so proud
 
 about having to be scrounging for your next meal
 
 
 
 how does it feel
 
 how does it feel
 
 to be without a home
 
 like a complete unknown
 
 like a rolling stone
 
 
 
 you’ve gone to the finest school all right, miss lonely
 
 but you know you only used to get juiced in it
 
 and nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
 
 and now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
 
 you said you’d never compromise
 
 with the mystery tramp, but now you realize
 
 he’s not selling any alibis
 
 as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
 
 and ask him do you want to make a deal
 
 
 
 how does it feel
 
 how does it feel
 
 to be on your own
 
 with no direction home
 
 like a complete unknown
 
 like a rolling stone
 
 
 
 you never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
 
 when they all come down and did tricks for you
 
 you never understood that it ain’t no good
 
 you shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you
 
 you used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
 
 who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
 
 ain’t it hard when you discover that
 
 he really wasn’t where it’s at
 
 after he took from you everything he could steal

 you used to be so amused
 
 at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 
 go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
 
 when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
 
 you’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

1965,Bringing It All Back Home,Bob Dylan's 115th Deam,"i was riding on the mayflower
 
 when i thought i spied some land
 
 i yelled for captain arab
 
 i have yuh understand
 
 who came running to the deck
 
 said, “boys, forget the whale
 
 look on over yonder
 
 cut the engines
 
 change the sail
 
 haul on the bowline”
 
 we sang that melody
 
 like all tough sailors do
 
 when they are far away at sea
 
 
 
 “i think i’ll call it america”
 
 i said as we hit land
 
 i took a deep breath
 
 i fell down, i could not stand
 
 captain arab he started
 
 writing up some deeds
 
 he said, “let’s set up a fort
 
 and start buying the place with beads”
 
 just then this cop comes down the street
 
 crazy as a loon
 
 he throw us all in jail
 
 for carryin’ harpoons
 
 
 
 ah me i busted out
 
 don’t even ask me how
 
 i went to get some help
 
 i walked by a guernsey cow
 
 who directed me down
 
 to the bowery slums
 
 where people carried signs around
 
 saying, “ban the bums”
 
 i jumped right into line
 
 sayin’, “i hope that i’m not late”
 
 when i realized i hadn’t eaten
 
 for five days straight
 
 
 
 i went into a restaurant
 
 lookin’ for the cook
 
 i told them i was the editor
 
 of a famous etiquette book
 
 the waitress he was handsome
 
 he wore a powder blue cape
 
 i ordered some suzette, i said
 
 “could you please make that crepe”
 
 just then the whole kitchen exploded
 
 from boilin’ fat
 
 food was flying everywhere
 
 and i left without my hat
 
 
 
 now, i didn’t mean to be nosy
 
 but i went into a bank
 
 to get some bail for arab
 
 and all the boys back in the tank
 
 they asked me for some collateral
 
 and i pulled down my pants
 
 they threw me in the alley
 
 when up comes this girl from france
 
 who invited me to her house
 
 i went, but she had a friend
 
 who knocked me out
 
 and robbed my boots
 
 and i was on the street again
 
 
 
 well, i rapped upon a house
 
 with the u.s. flag upon display
 
 i said, “could you help me out
 
 i got some friends down the way”
 
 the man says, “get out of here
 
 i’ll tear you limb from limb”
 
 i said, “you know they refused jesus, too”
 
 he said, “you’re not him
 
 get out of here before i break your bones
 
 i ain’t your pop”
 
 i decided to have him arrested
 
 and i went looking for a cop
 
 
 
 i ran right outside
 
 and i hopped inside a cab
 
 i went out the other door
 
 this englishman said, “fab”
 
 as he saw me leap a hot dog stand
 
 and a chariot that stood
 
 parked across from a building
 
 advertising brotherhood
 
 i ran right through the front door
 
 like a hobo sailor does
 
 but it was just a funeral parlor
 
 and the man asked me who i was
 
 
 
 i repeated that my friends
 
 were all in jail, with a sigh
 
 he gave me his card
 
 he said, “call me if they die”
 
 i shook his hand and said goodbye
 
 ran out to the street
 
 when a bowling ball came down the road
 
 and knocked me off my feet
 
 a pay phone was ringing
 
 it just about blew my mind
 
 when i picked it up and said hello
 
 this foot came through the line
 
 
 
 well, by this time i was fed up
 
 at tryin’ to make a stab
 
 at bringin’ back any help
 
 for my friends and captain arab
 
 i decided to flip a coin
 
 like either heads or tails
 
 would let me know if i should go
 
 back to ship or back to jail
 
 so i hocked my sailor suit
 
 and i got a coin to flip
 
 it came up tails
 
 it rhymed with sails
 
 so i made it back to the ship
 
 
 
 
 
 well, i got back and took
 
 the parkin’ ticket off the mast
 
 i was ripping it to shreds
 
 when this coastguard boat went past
 
 they asked me my name
 
 and i said, “captain kidd”
 
 they believed me but
 
 they wanted to know
 
 what exactly that i did
 
 i said for the pope of eruke
 
 i was employed
 
 they let me go right away
 
 they were very paranoid
 
 
 
 well, the last i heard of arab
 
 he was stuck on a whale
 
 that was married to the deputy
 
 sheriff of the jail
 
 but the funniest thing was
 
 when i was leavin’ the bay
 
 i saw three ships a-sailin’
 
 they were all heading my way
 
 i asked the captain what his name was
 
 and how come he didn’t drive a truck
 
 he said his name was columbus
 
 i just said, “good luck”"

 “don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”

 it was then that i got up to leave
 
 but she said, “don’t forget
 
 everybody must give something back
 
 for something they get”
 
 
 
 i stood there and hummed
 
 i tapped on her drum and asked her how come
 
 and she buttoned her boot
 
 and straightened her suit
 
 then she said, “don’t get cute”
 
 so i forced my hands in my pockets
 
 and felt with my thumbs
 
 and gallantly handed her
 
 my very last piece of gum
 
 
 
 she threw me outside
 
 i stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked
 
 and after finding i’d
 
 forgotten my shirt
 
 i went back and knocked
 
 i waited in the hallway, she went to get it
 
 and i tried to make sense
 
 out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
 
 that leaned up against . . .
 
 
 
 her jamaican rum
 
 and when she did come, i asked her for some
 
 she said, “no, dear”
 
 i said, “your words aren’t clear
 
 you’d better spit out your gum”
 
 she screamed till her face got so red
 
 then she fell on the floor
 
 and i covered her up and then
 
 thought i’d go look through her drawer
 
 
 
 and when i was through
 
 i filled up my shoe
 
 and brought it to you

 my warehouse eyes, my arabian drums

 with your holy medallion which your fingertips fold

1966,Blonde on Blonde,Visions of Johanna,"ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet
 
 we sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
 
 and louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
 
 lights flicker from the opposite loft
 
 in this room the heat pipes just cough
 
 the country music station plays soft
 
 but there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
 
 just louise and her lover so entwined
 
 and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind
 
 
 
 in the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain
 
 and the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “d” train
 
 we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
 
 ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane
 
 louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
 
 she’s delicate and seems like the mirror
 
 but she just makes it all too concise and too clear
 
 that johanna’s not here
 
 the ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
 
 where these visions of johanna have now taken my place
 
 
 
 now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
 
 he brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
 
 and when bringing her name up
 
 he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
 
 he’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
 
 muttering small talk at the wall while i’m in the hall
 
 how can i explain
 
 oh, it’s so hard to get on
 
 and these visions of johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
 
 
 
 inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
 
 voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
 
 but mona lisa musta had the highway blues
 
 you can tell by the way she smiles
 
 see the primitive wallflower freeze
 
 when the jelly-faced women all sneeze
 
 hear the one with the mustache say, “jeeze
 
 i can’t find my knees”
 
 oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
 
 but these visions of johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
 
 
 
 the peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
 
 sayin’, “name me someone that’s not a parasite and i’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
 
 but like louise always says
 
 “ya can’t look at much, can ya man”
 
 as she, herself, prepares for him
 
 and madonna, she still has not showed
 
 we see this empty cage now corrode
 
 where her cape of the stage once had flowed
 
 the fiddler, he now steps to the road
 
 he writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
 
 on the back of the fish truck that loads
 
 while my conscience explodes
 
 the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
 
 and these visions of johanna are now all that remain"

1967,John Wesley Harding,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"i dreamed i saw st. augustine
 
 alive as you or me
 
 tearing through these quarters
 
 in the utmost misery
 
 with a blanket underneath his arm
 
 and a coat of solid gold
 
 searching for the very souls
 
 whom already have been sold
 
 
 
 “arise, arise,” he cried so loud
 
 in a voice without restraint
 
 “come out, ye gifted kings and queens
 
 and hear my sad complaint
 
 no martyr is among ye now
 
 whom you can call your own
 
 so go on your way accordingly
 
 but know you’re not alone”
 
 
 
 i dreamed i saw st. augustine
 
 alive with fiery breath
 
 and i dreamed i was amongst the ones
 
 that put him out to death
 
 oh, i awoke in anger
 
 so alone and terrified
 
 i put my fingers against the glass
 
 and bowed my head and cried"
1967,John Wesley Harding,The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,"well, frankie lee and judas priest
 
 they were the best of friends
 
 so when frankie lee needed money one day
 
 judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
 
 and placed them on a footstool
 
 just above the plotted plain
 
 sayin’, “take your pick, frankie boy
 
 my loss will be your gain”
 
 
 
 well, frankie lee, he sat right down
 
 and put his fingers to his chin
 
 but with the cold eyes of judas on him
 
 his head began to spin
 
 “would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said
 
 “it’s just my foolish pride
 
 but sometimes a man must be alone
 
 and this is no place to hide”
 
 
 
 well, judas, he just winked and said
 
 “all right, i’ll leave you here
 
 but you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
 
 before they all disappear”
 
 “i’m gonna start my pickin’ right now
 
 just tell me where you’ll be”
 
 judas pointed down the road
 
 and said, “eternity”
 
 
 
 “eternity” said frankie lee
 
 with a voice as cold as ice
 
 “that’s right,” said judas priest, “eternity
 
 though you might call it ‘paradise’”
 
 “i don’t call it anything”
 
 said frankie lee with a smile
 
 “all right,” said judas priest
 
 “i’ll see you after a while”
 
 
 
 well, frankie lee, he sat back down
 
 feelin’ low and mean
 
 when just then a passing stranger
 
 burst upon the scene
 
 saying, “are you frankie lee, the gambler
 
 whose father is deceased
 
 well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin’ you down the road
 
 and they say his name is priest”
 
 
 
 “oh, yes, he is my friend”
 
 said frankie lee in fright
 
 “i do recall him very well
 
 in fact, he just left my sight”
 
 “yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger
 
 as quiet as a mouse
 
 “well, my message is, he’s down the road
 
 stranded in a house”
 
 
 
 well, frankie lee, he panicked
 
 he dropped ev’rything and ran
 
 until he came up to the spot
 
 where judas priest did stand
 
 “what kind of house is this,” he said
 
 “where i have come to roam”
 
 “it’s not a house,” said judas priest
 
 “it’s not a house . . . it’s a home”
 
 
 
 well, frankie lee, he trembled
 
 he soon lost all control
 
 over ev’rything which he had made
 
 while the mission bells did toll
 
 he just stood there staring
 
 at that big house as bright as any sun
 
 with four and twenty windows
 
 and a woman’s face in ev’ry one
 
 
 
 well, up the stairs ran frankie lee
 
 with a soulful, bounding leap
 
 and, foaming at the mouth
 
 he began to make his midnight creep
 
 for sixteen nights and days he raved
 
 but on the seventeenth he burst
 
 into the arms of judas priest
 
 which is where he died of thirst
 
 
 
 no one tried to say a thing
 
 when they took him out in jest
 
 except, of course, the little neighbor boy
 
 who carried him to rest
 
 and he just walked along, alone
 
 with his guilt so well concealed
 
 and muttered underneath his breath
 
 “nothing is revealed”
 
 
 
 well, the moral of the story
 
 the moral of this song
 
 is simply that one should never be
 
 where one does not belong
 
 so when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’
 
 help him with his load
 
 and don’t go mistaking paradise
 
 for that home across the road"
1967,John Wesley Harding,I Pity the Poor Immigrant,"i pity the poor immigrant
 
 who wishes he would’ve stayed home
 
 who uses all his power to do evil
 
 but in the end is always left so alone
 
 that man whom with his fingers cheats
 
 and who lies with ev’ry breath
 
 who passionately hates his life
 
 and likewise, fears his death
 
 
 
 i pity the poor immigrant
 
 whose strength is spent in vain
 
 whose heaven is like ironsides
 
 whose tears are like rain
 
 who eats but is not satisfied
 
 who hears but does not see
 
 who falls in love with wealth itself
 
 and turns his back on me
 
 
 
 i pity the poor immigrant
 
 who tramples through the mud
 
 who fills his mouth with laughing
 
 and who builds his town with blood
 
 whose visions in the final end
 
 must shatter like the glass
 
 i pity the poor immigrant
 
 when his gladness comes to pass"

i hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed

and the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed

i went out on lower broadway and i felt that place within

that hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin



heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped

acting out his folly while his back is being whipped

like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’til he’s tame

all for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame



there are those who worship loneliness, i’m not one of them

in this age of fiberglass i’m searching for a gem

the crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet

i’ve paid the price of solitude, but at last i’m out of debt



can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me

’cept pat me on the back one time when i was on my knees

we stared into each other’s eyes ’til one of us would break

no use to apologize, what diff’rence would it make

rainy days on the great lakes, walkin’ the hills of old duluth

suddenly i found you and the spirit in me sings

don’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things

i could say that i’d be faithful, i could say it in one sweet, easy breath

but to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

you breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live

when i was deep in poverty you taught me how to give

dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole

quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul



you gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life

eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife

and if there is eternity i’d love you there again

and i was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride

you’re the other half of what i am, you’re the missing piece

on a night like this

so glad you’ve come to stay

hold on to me, pretty miss

say you’ll never go away to stray

run your fingers down my spine

bring me a touch of bliss

it sure feels right

on a night like this



on a night like this

i can’t get any sleep

the air is so cold outside

and the snow’s so deep

build a fire, throw on logs

and listen to it hiss

and let it burn, burn, burn, burn

on a night like this



put your body next to mine

and keep me company

there is plenty a-room for all

so please don’t elbow me



let the four winds blow

around this old cabin door

if i’m not too far off

i think we did this once before

there’s more frost on the window glass

with each new tender kiss

but it sure feels right

on a night like this"
1974,Planet Waves,Never say goodbye,"twilight on the frozen lake

north wind about to break

on footprints in the snow

silence down below



you’re beautiful beyond words

you’re beautiful to me

you can make me cry

never say goodbye



time is all i have to give

you can have it if you choose

with me you can live

never say goodbye



my dreams are made of iron and steel

with a big bouquet

of roses hanging down

from the heavens to the ground



the crashing waves roll over me

as i stand upon the sand

wait for you to come

and grab hold of my hand



oh, baby, baby, baby blue

you’ll change your last name, too

you’ve turned your hair to brown

love to see it hangin’ down"
1974,Planet Waves,You Angel You,"you angel you

you got me under your wing

the way you walk and the way you talk

i feel i could almost sing



you angel you

you’re as fine as anything’s fine

the way you walk and the way you talk

it sure plays on my mind



you know i can’t sleep at night for trying

never did feel this way before

i get up at night and walk the floor

if this is love then gimme more

and more and more and more and more



you angel you

you’re as fine as can be

the way you smile like a sweet baby child

it just falls all over me



you know i can’t sleep at night for trying

never did feel this way before

never did get up and walk the floor

if this is love then gimme more

and more and more and more



you angel you

you got me under your wing

the way you walk and the way you talk

it says everything"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,Simple Twist of Fate,"they sat together in the park

as the evening sky grew dark

she looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones

’twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight

and watched out for a simple twist of fate



they walked along by the old canal

a little confused, i remember well

and stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright

he felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train

moving with a simple twist of fate



a saxophone someplace far off played

as she was walkin’ by the arcade

as the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,

she dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate

and forgot about a simple twist of fate



he woke up, the room was bare

he didn’t see her anywhere

he told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide

felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate

brought on by a simple twist of fate



he hears the ticking of the clocks

and walks along with a parrot that talks

hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in

maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait

once more for a simple twist of fate



people tell me it’s a sin

to know and feel too much within

i still believe she was my twin, but i lost the ring

she was born in spring, but i was born too late

blame it on a simple twist of fate"
1975,Biograph,Abandoned Love,"i can see the turning of the key
i've been deceived by the clown inside of me
i thought that he was righteous but he's vain
oh, something's a-telling me i wear the ball and chain
my patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
he's always off somewhere when i need him most
the spanish moon is rising on the hill
but my heart is a-tellin' me i love you still
i come back to the town from the flaming moon
i see you in the streets, i begin to swoon
i love to see you dress before the mirror
won't you let me in your room one time before i finally disappear
everybody's wearing a disguise
to hide what they've got left behind their eyes
but me, i can't cover what i am
wherever the children go i'll follow them
i march in the parade of liberty
but as long as i love you i'm not free
how long must i suffer such abuse
won't you let me see your smile before i turn you loose
i've given up the game, i've got to leave
the pot of gold is only make-believe
the treasure can't be found by men who search
whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church
we sat in an empty theater and we kissed
i asked ya please to cross me off your list
my head tells me it's time to make a change
but my heart is telling me i love ya but you're strange
so one more time at midnight, near the wall
take off your heavy make-up and your shawl
won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit
let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it"
1975,Biograph,Up to Me,"everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing

death kept followin’, trackin’ us down, at least i heard your bluebird sing

now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy

i know you’re long gone, i guess it must be up to me



if i’d thought about it i never would’ve done it, i guess i would’ve let it slide

if i’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died

i was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity

someone had to reach for the risin’ star, i guess it was up to me



oh, the union central is pullin’ out and the orchids are in bloom

i’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume

in fourteen months i’ve only smiled once and i didn’t do it consciously

somebody’s got to find your trail, i guess it must be up to me



it was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch

i’d just about convinced myself that nothin’ had changed that much

the old rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key

somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me



well, i watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club

i would’ve followed you in the door but i didn’t have a ticket stub

so i waited all night ’til the break of day, hopin’ one of us could get free

when the dawn came over the river bridge, i knew it was up to me



oh, the only decent thing i did when i worked as a postal clerk

was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where i used to work

was i a fool or not to try to protect your identity

you looked a little burned out, my friend, i thought it might be up to me



well, i met somebody face to face and i had to remove my hat

she’s everything i need and love but i can’t be swayed by that

it frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be

but she ain’t a-gonna make me move, i guess it must be up to me



we heard the sermon on the mount and i knew it was too complex

it didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects

when you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty

somebody’s got to tell the tale, i guess it must be up to me



well, dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the thunderbird café

crystal wanted to talk to him, i had to look the other way

well, i just can’t rest without you, love, i need your company

but you ain’t a-gonna cross the line, i guess it must be up to me



there’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to estelle

she’s the one you been wond’rin’ about, but there’s really nothin’ much to tell

we both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history

somebody’s got to cry some tears, i guess it must be up to me



so go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime

the ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time

and the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property

one of us has got to hit the road, i guess it must be up to me



and if we never meet again, baby, remember me

how my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody

and the harmonica around my neck, i blew it for you, free

no one else could play that tune, you know it was up to m"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,You're Big Girl Now,"our conversation was short and sweet

it nearly swept me off-a my feet

and i’m back in the rain, oh, oh

and you are on dry land

you made it there somehow

you’re a big girl now



bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence

he’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense

and i’m just like that bird, oh, oh

singin’ just for you

i hope that you can hear

hear me singin’ through these tears



time is a jet plane, it moves too fast

oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last

i can change, i swear, oh, oh

see what you can do

i can make it through

you can make it too



love is so simple, to quote a phrase

you’ve known it all the time, i’m learnin’ it these days

oh, i know where i can find you, oh, oh

in somebody’s room

it’s a price i have to pay

you’re a big girl all the way



a change in the weather is known to be extreme

but what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream

i’m going out of my mind, oh, oh

with a pain that stops and starts

like a corkscrew to my heart

1975,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Golden Loom,"smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky

i see the sailin’ boats across the bay go by

eucalyptus trees hang above the street

and then i turn my head, for you’re approachin’ me

moonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floatin’ in to my room

with a golden loom



first we wash our feet near the immortal shrine

and then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine

i see the hungry clouds up above your face

and then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste

and then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom

with your golden loom



i walk across the bridge in the dismal light

where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night

i see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail

and then i kiss your lips as i lift your veil

but you’re gone and then all i seem to recall is the smell of perfume

and your golden loom"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,Shelter from the Storm,"’twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood

when blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud

i came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



and if i pass this way again, you can rest assured

i’ll always do my best for her, on that i give my word

in a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved

everything up to that point had been left unresolved

try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



i was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail

poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail

hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



suddenly i turned around and she was standin’ there

with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair

she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost

i took too much for granted, got my signals crossed

just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount

but nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts

and the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



i’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove

and old men with broken teeth stranded without love

do i understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



in a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes

i bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose

i offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”



well, i’m livin’ in a foreign country but i’m bound to cross the line

beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday i’ll make it mine

if i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born

“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts","the festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall

the cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall

the curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down

anyone with any sense had already left town

he was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the jack of hearts



he moved across the mirrored room, “set it up for everyone,” he said

then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads

then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin

“could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins”

then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts



backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs

lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair

outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide

a gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside

lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts



big jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine

he made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine

with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place

he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste

but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts



rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town

she slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown

she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear

“sorry, darlin’, that i’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear

he was starin’ into space over at the jack of hearts



“i know i’ve seen that face before,” big jim was thinkin’ to himself

“maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”

but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim

and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him

starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts



lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child

she did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled

she’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs

with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere

but she’d never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts



the hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined

the drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind

it was known all around that lily had jim’s ring

and nothing would ever come between lily and the king

no, nothin’ ever would except maybe the jack of hearts



rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife

she was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of big jim’s wife

she had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide

was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died

she was gazin’ to the future, riding on the jack of hearts



lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away

“has your luck run out” she laughed at him, “well, i guess you must

    have known it would someday

be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint

i’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”

down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the jack of hearts



the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair

“there’s something funny going on,” he said, “i can just feel it in the air”

he went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk

as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk

there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts



lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch

she forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much

“i’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere

but just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear

just another night in the life of the jack of hearts



no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick

the door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked

and big jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised

rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes

she was with big jim but she was leanin’ to the jack of hearts



two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall

and cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul

in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground

for one more member who had business back in town

but they couldn’t go no further without the jack of hearts



the next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black

big jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back

and rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink

the hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink

the only person on the scene missin’ was the jack of hearts



the cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “closed for repair”

lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair

she was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw

thinkin’ ’bout rosemary and thinkin’ about the law

but most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the jack of hearts"

1975,Blood on the Tracks,Tangled up in blue,"early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’

i was layin’ in bed

wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all

if her hair was still red

her folks they said our lives together

sure was gonna be rough

they never did like mama’s homemade dress

papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough

and i was standin’ on the side of the road

rain fallin’ on my shoes

heading out for the east coast

lord knows i’ve paid some dues gettin’ through

tangled up in blue



she was married when we first met

soon to be divorced

i helped her out of a jam, i guess

but i used a little too much force

we drove that car as far as we could

abandoned it out west

split up on a dark sad night

both agreeing it was best

she turned around to look at me

as i was walkin’ away

i heard her say over my shoulder

“we’ll meet again someday on the avenue”

tangled up in blue



i had a job in the great north woods

working as a cook for a spell

but i never did like it all that much

and one day the ax just fell

so i drifted down to new orleans

where i happened to be employed

workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat

right outside of delacroix

but all the while i was alone

the past was close behind

i seen a lot of women

but she never escaped my mind, and i just grew

tangled up in blue



she was workin’ in a topless place

and i stopped in for a beer

i just kept lookin’ at the side of her face

in the spotlight so clear

and later on as the crowd thinned out

i’s just about to do the same

she was standing there in back of my chair

said to me, “don’t i know your name”

i muttered somethin’ underneath my breath

she studied the lines on my face

i must admit i felt a little uneasy

when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe

tangled up in blue



she lit a burner on the stove

and offered me a pipe

“i thought you’d never say hello,” she said

“you look like the silent type”

then she opened up a book of poems

and handed it to me

written by an italian poet

from the thirteenth century

and every one of them words rang true

and glowed like burnin’ coal

pourin’ off of every page

like it was written in my soul from me to you

tangled up in blue



i lived with them on montague street

in a basement down the stairs

there was music in the cafés at night

and revolution in the air

then he started into dealing with slaves

and something inside of him died

she had to sell everything she owned

and froze up inside

and when finally the bottom fell out

i became withdrawn

the only thing i knew how to do

was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew

tangled up in blue



so now i’m goin’ back again

i got to get to her somehow

all the people we used to know

they’re an illusion to me now

some are mathematicians

some are carpenters’ wives

don’t know how it all got started

i don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives

but me, i’m still on the road

headin’ for another joint

we always did feel the same

we just saw it from a different point of view

it’s the city ’cross the water, not too far from here

say for me that i’m all right though things are kind of slow

she might think that i’ve forgotten her. don’t tell her it isn’t so



we had a falling-out, like lovers sometimes do

but to think of how she left that night, it hurts me through and through

and though our situation pierced me to the bone

i got to find someone to take her place. i don’t like to be alone



i see a lot of people as i make the rounds

and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town

and i’ve never gotten used to it, i’ve just learned to turn it off

her eyes were blue, her hair was too, her skin so sweet and soft



sundown, yellow moon, i replay the past

i know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast

if she’s passin’ back this way, and i sure hope she don’t

tell her she can look me up. i’ll either be here or i won’t"

1975,Blood on the Tracks,Idiot Wind,"someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press

whoever it is i wish they’d cut it out but when they will i can only guess

they say i shot a man named gray and took his wife to italy

she inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me

i can’t help it if i’m lucky



people see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act

their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts

even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at

i couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that

sweet lady



idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth

blowing down the backroads headin’ south

idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth

you’re an idiot, babe

it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe



i ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike

i haven’t known peace and quiet for so long i can’t remember what it’s like

there’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door

you didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars

after losin’ every battle



i woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are

visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars

you hurt the ones that i love best and cover up the truth with lies

one day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes

blood on your saddle



idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb

blowing through the curtains in your room

idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth

you’re an idiot, babe

it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe



it was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart

you tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart

now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped

what’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top

you’re on the bottom



i noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind

i can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes

    don’t look into mine

the priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the

    building burned

i waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the

    springtime turned

slowly into autumn



idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull

from the grand coulee dam to the capitol

idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth

you’re an idiot, babe

it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe



i can’t feel you anymore, i can’t even touch the books you’ve read

every time i crawl past your door, i been wishin’ i was somebody else instead

down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy

i followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory

and all your ragin’ glory



i been double-crossed now for the very last time and now i’m finally free

i kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me

you’ll never know the hurt i suffered nor the pain i rise above

and i’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love

and it makes me feel so sorry



idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats

blowing through the letters that we wrote

idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves

we’re idiots, babe

it’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves"

1976,Desire,Hurricane,"pistol shots ring out in the barroom night

enter patty valentine from the upper hall

she sees the bartender in a pool of blood

cries out, “my god, they killed them all”

here comes the story of the hurricane

the man the authorities came to blame

for somethin’ that he never done

put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

the champion of the world



three bodies lyin’ there does patty see

and another man named bello, movin’ around mysteriously

“i didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands

“i was only robbin’ the register, i hope you understand

i saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops

“one of us had better call up the cops”

and so patty calls the cops

and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’

in the hot new jersey night



meanwhile, far away in another part of town

rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around

number one contender for the middleweight crown

had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road

just like the time before and the time before that

in paterson that’s just the way things go

if you’re black you might as well not show up on the street

’less you wanna draw the heat



alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops

him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin’ around

he said, “i saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights

they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

and miss patty valentine just nodded her head

cop said, “wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”

so they took him to the infirmary

and though this man could hardly see

they told him that he could identify the guilty men



four in the mornin’ and they haul rubin in

take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs

the wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye

says, “wha’d you bring him in here for he ain’t the guy”

yes, here’s the story of the hurricane

the man the authorities came to blame

for somethin’ that he never done

put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

the champion of the world



four months later, the ghettos are in flame

rubin’s in south america, fightin’ for his name

while arthur dexter bradley’s still in the robbery game

and the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame

“remember that murder that happened in a bar”

“remember you said you saw the getaway car”

“you think you’d like to play ball with the law”

“think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night”

“don’t forget that you are white”



arthur dexter bradley said, “i’m really not sure”

cops said, “a poor boy like you could use a break

we got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend bello

now you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow

you’ll be doin’ society a favor

that sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver

we want to put his ass in stir

we want to pin this triple murder on him

he ain’t no gentleman jim”



rubin could take a man out with just one punch

but he never did like to talk about it all that much

it’s my work, he’d say, and i do it for pay

and when it’s over i’d just as soon go on my way

up to some paradise

where the trout streams flow and the air is nice

and ride a horse along a trail

but then they took him to the jailhouse

where they try to turn a man into a mouse



all of rubin’s cards were marked in advance

the trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance

the judge made rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums

to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger

no one doubted that he pulled the trigger

and though they could not produce the gun

the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed

and the all-white jury agreed



rubin carter was falsely tried

the crime was murder “one,” guess who testified

bello and bradley and they both baldly lied

and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

how can the life of such a man

be in the palm of some fool’s hand

to see him obviously framed

couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land

where justice is a game



now all the criminals in their coats and their ties

are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise

while rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell

an innocent man in a living hell

that’s the story of the hurricane

but it won’t be over till they clear his name

and give him back the time he’s done

put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

the champion of the world"
1976,Desire,Mozambique,"i like to spend some time in mozambique

the sunny sky is aqua blue

and all the couples dancing cheek to cheek

it’s very nice to stay a week or two



there’s lot of pretty girls in mozambique

and plenty time for good romance

and everybody likes to stop and speak

to give the special one you seek a chance

or maybe say hello with just a glance



lying next to her by the ocean

reaching out and touching her hand

whispering your secret emotion

magic in a magical land



and when it’s time for leaving mozambique

to say goodbye to sand and sea

you turn around to take a final peek

and you see why it’s so unique to be

among the lovely people living free

upon the beach of sunny mozambique"

1976,Desire,Isis,"i married isis on the fifth day of may

but i could not hold on to her very long

so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away

for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong



i came to a high place of darkness and light

the dividing line ran through the center of town

i hitched up my pony to a post on the right

went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down



a man in the corner approached me for a match

i knew right away he was not ordinary

he said, “are you lookin’ for somethin’ easy to catch”

i said, “i got no money.” he said, “that ain’t necessary”



we set out that night for the cold in the north

i gave him my blanket, he gave me his word

i said, “where are we goin’” he said we’d be back by the fourth

i said, “that’s the best news that i’ve ever heard”



i was thinkin’ about turquoise, i was thinkin’ about gold

i was thinkin’ about diamonds and the world’s biggest necklace

as we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold

i was thinkin’ about isis, how she thought i was so reckless



how she told me that one day we would meet up again

and things would be different the next time we wed

if i only could hang on and just be her friend

i still can’t remember all the best things she said



we came to the pyramids all embedded in ice

he said, “there’s a body i’m tryin’ to find

if i carry it out it’ll bring a good price”

’twas then that i knew what he had on his mind



the wind it was howlin’ and the snow was outrageous

we chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn

when he died i was hopin’ that it wasn’t contagious

but i made up my mind that i had to go on



i broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty

there was no jewels, no nothin’, i felt i’d been had

when i saw that my partner was just bein’ friendly

when i took up his offer i must-a been mad



i picked up his body and i dragged him inside

threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover

i said a quick prayer and i felt satisfied

then i rode back to find isis just to tell her i love her



she was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise

blinded by sleep and in need of a bed

i came in from the east with the sun in my eyes

i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead



she said, “where ya been” i said, “no place special”

she said, “you look different.” i said, “well, not quite”

she said, “you been gone.” i said, “that’s only natural”

she said, “you gonna stay” i said, “yeah, i jes might”



isis, oh, isis, you mystical child

what drives me to you is what drives me insane

i still can remember the way that you smiled

on the fifth day of may in the drizzlin’ rain"
1976,Desire,Romance in Durango,"hot chili peppers in the blistering sun

dust on my face and my cape

me and magdalena on the run

i think this time we shall escape



sold my guitar to the baker’s son

for a few crumbs and a place to hide

but i can get another one

and i’ll play for magdalena as we ride



no llores, mi querida

dios nos vigila

soon the horse will take us to durango

agarrame, mi vida

soon the desert will be gone

soon you will be dancing the fandango



past the aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people

hoofbeats like castanets on stone

at night i dream of bells in the village steeple

then i see the bloody face of ramon



was it me that shot him down in the cantina

was it my hand that held the gun

come, let us fly, my magdalena

the dogs are barking and what’s done is done



no ilores, mi querida

dios nos vigila

soon the horse will take us to durango

agarrame, mi vida

soon the desert will be gone

soon you will be dancing the fandango



at the corrida we’ll sit in the shade

and watch the young torero stand alone

we’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed

when they rode with villa into torreón



then the padre will recite the prayers of old

in the little church this side of town

i will wear new boots and an earring of gold

you’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown



the way is long but the end is near

already the fiesta has begun

the face of god will appear

with his serpent eyes of obsidian



no ilores, mi querida

dio nos vigila

soon the horse will take us to durango

agarrame, mi vida

soon the desert will be gone

soon you will be dancing the fandango



was that the thunder that i heard

my head is vibrating, i feel a sharp pain

come sit by me, don’t say a word

oh, can it be that i am slain



quick, magdalena, take my gun

look up in the hills, that flash of light

aim well my little one

we may not make it through the night



no ilores, mi querida

dios nos vigila

soon the horse will take us to durango

agarrame, mi vida

soon the desert will be gone

soon you will be dancing the fandango"
1976,Desire,Black Diamond Bay,"up on the white veranda

she wears a necktie and a panama hat

her passport shows a face

from another time and place

she looks nothin’ like that

and all the remnants of her recent past

are scattered in the wild wind

she walks across the marble floor

where a voice from the gambling room is callin’ her to come on in

she smiles, walks the other way

as the last ship sails and the moon fades away

from black diamond bay



as the mornin’ light breaks open, the greek comes down

and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write

“pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says

carefully removes his fez

“am i hearin’ you right”

and as the yellow fog is liftin’

the greek is quickly headin’ for the second floor

she passes him on the spiral staircase

thinkin’ he’s the soviet ambassador

she starts to speak, but he walks away

as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway

on black diamond bay



a soldier sits beneath the fan

doin’ business with a tiny man who sells him a ring

lightning strikes, the lights blow out

the desk clerk wakes and begins to shout

“can you see anything”

then the greek appears on the second floor

in his bare feet with a rope around his neck

while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle

says, “open up another deck”

but the dealer says, “attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”

as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away

from black diamond bay



the desk clerk heard the woman laugh

as he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough

he tried to grab the woman’s hand

said, “here’s a ring, it cost a grand”

she said, “that ain’t enough”

then she ran upstairs to pack her bags

while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb

she passed the door that the greek had locked

where a handwritten sign read, “do not disturb”

she knocked upon it anyway

as the sun went down and the music did play

on black diamond bay



“i’ve got to talk to someone quick”

but the greek said, “go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor

he hung there from the chandelier

she cried, “help, there’s danger near

please open up the door”

then the volcano erupted

and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above

the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner

thinking of forbidden love

but the desk clerk said, “it happens every day”

as the stars fell down and the fields burned away

on black diamond bay



as the island slowly sank

the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room

the dealer said, “it’s too late now

you can take your money, but i don’t know how

you’ll spend it in the tomb”

the tiny man bit the soldier’s ear

as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew

while she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her

“my darling, je vous aime beaucoup”

she sheds a tear and then begins to pray

as the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away

from black diamond bay



i was sittin’ home alone one night in l.a.

watchin’ old cronkite on the seven o’clock news

it seems there was an earthquake that

left nothin’ but a panama hat

and a pair of old greek shoes

didn’t seem like much was happenin’,

so i turned it off and went to grab another beer

seems like every time you turn around

there’s another hard-luck story that you’re gonna hear

and there’s really nothin’ anyone can say

and i never did plan to go anyway

to black diamond bay"

1976,Desire,Joey,"born in red hook, brooklyn, in the year of who knows when

opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion

always on the outside of whatever side there was

when they asked him why it had to be that way, “well,” he answered,

    “just because”



larry was the oldest, joey was next to last

they called joe “crazy,” the baby they called “kid blast”

some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too

it always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue



joey, joey

king of the streets, child of clay

joey, joey

what made them want to come and blow you away



there was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that

no one ever knew for sure where they were really at

when they tried to strangle larry, joey almost hit the roof

he went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof



the war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets

joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats

till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners

they stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs



the hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim

“let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let con edison take the blame”

but joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “we’re not those kind of men

it’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”



joey, joey

king of the streets, child of clay

joey, joey

what made them want to come and blow you away



the police department hounded him, they called him mr. smith

they got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with

“what time is it” said the judge to joey when they met

“five to ten,” said joey. the judge says, “that’s exactly what you get”



he did ten years in attica, reading nietzsche and wilhelm reich

they threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike

his closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand

what it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand



when they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight

but he dressed like jimmy cagney and i swear he did look great

he tried to find the way back into the life he left behind

to the boss he said, “i have returned and now i want what’s mine”



joey, joey

king of the streets, child of clay

joey, joey

why did they have to come and blow you away



it was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun

“i’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”

yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe

emptied out the register, said, “tell ’em it was crazy joe”



one day they blew him down in a clam bar in new york

he could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork

he pushed the table over to protect his family

then he staggered out into the streets of little italy



joey, joey

king of the streets, child of clay

joey, joey

what made them want to come and blow you away



sister jacqueline and carmela and mother mary all did weep

i heard his best friend frankie say, “he ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”

then i saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave

i guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save



the sun turned cold over president street and the town of brooklyn mourned

they said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born

and someday if god’s in heaven overlookin’ his preserve

i know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety

you fight for the throne and you travel alone

unknown as you slowly sink

and there’s no time to think

in secret, for pieces of change

and it makes you feel violent and strange



memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy

betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss

anytime, anyplace, anywhere



mercury, gravity, nobility, humility

for pleasure you must now resist

lovers obey you but they cannot sway you

they’re not even sure you exist



socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism

fools making laws for the breaking of jaws

and the sound of the keys as they clink

the bridge that you travel on goes to the babylon girl

with the rose in her hair

starlight in the east and you’re finally released

you’re stranded but with nothing to share



loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity

’neath the moon shinin’ bloody and pink

stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt

i’m exiled, you can’t convert me

i’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways

with both eyes glazed



you don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone

somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home



i guess i’ll be leaving tomorrow

if i have to beg, steal or borrow

it’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half

look at each other and laugh



but i don’t think it’s liable to happen

like the sound of one hand clappin’

the vows that we kept are now broken and swept

’neath the bed where we slept



don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had

be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad

why should we go on watching each other through a telescope

eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope

i would wave a wand and tie back the bond

that we’ve both gone beyond"

but she’s drifting like a satellite



there’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze

laughter down on elizabeth street

and a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone

where she bathed in a stream of pure heat



her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise

but he practiced what he preached from the heart

a full-blooded cherokee, he predicted to me

the time and the place that the trouble would start



there’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage

and a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage

and she winds back the clock and she turns back the page

of a book that no one can write

oh, where are you tonight



the truth was obscure, too profound and too pure

to live it you have to explode

in that last hour of need, we entirely agreed

sacrifice was the code of the road



i left town at dawn, with marcel and st. john

strong men belittled by doubt

i couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were

but she had some way of finding them out



he took dead-center aim but he missed just the same

she was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf

she could feel my despair as i climbed up her hair

and discovered her invisible self



there’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped

there’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped

as her beauty fades and i watch her undrape

i won’t but then again, maybe i might

oh, if i could just find you tonight



i fought with my twin, that enemy within

’til both of us fell by the way

horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees

while the law looks the other way



your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes

the guy you were lovin’ couldn’t stay clean

it felt outa place, my foot in his face

but he should-a stayed where his money was green



i bit into the root of forbidden fruit

with the juice running down my leg

then i dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss

and who always was too proud to beg



there’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room

and a pathway that leads up to the stars

if you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise

remind me to show you the scars



there’s a new day at dawn and i’ve finally arrived

if i’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know i’ve survived

i can’t believe it, i can’t believe i’m alive

desperate men, desperate women divided

fortune calls

merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down

she’s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born

on midsummer’s eve, near the tower



the cold-blooded moon

the captain waits above the celebration

sending his thoughts to a beloved maid

whose ebony face is beyond communication

the captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid



they shaved her head

she was torn between jupiter and apollo

a messenger arrived with a black nightingale

i seen her on the stairs and i couldn’t help but follow

follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil



i stumbled to my feet

i rode past destruction in the ditches

with the stitches still mending ’neath a heart-shaped tattoo

renegade priests and treacherous young witches

were handing out the flowers that i’d given to you



the palace of mirrors

where dog soldiers are reflected

the endless road and the wailing of chimes

the empty rooms where her memory is protected

where the angels’ voices whisper to the souls of previous times



she wakes him up

forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking

near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks

she’s begging to know what measures he now will be taking

he’s pulling her down and she’s clutching on to his long golden locks



gentlemen, he said

i don’t need your organization, i’ve shined your shoes

i’ve moved your mountains and marked your cards

but eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination

or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards



peace will come

with tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire

but will bring us no reward when her false idols fall

and cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating

truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through

he unleashed his power at an unknown hour that no one knew

how long can i listen to the lies of prejudice

how long can i stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness

can i cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride

will i ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t cease

until he returns



surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask

he sees your deeds, he knows your needs even before you ask

how long can you falsify and deny what is real

how long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal

of every earthly plan that be known to man, he is unconcerned

he’s got plans of his own to set up his throne

in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed

you changed my life



talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired

they got a million things to do, they're all so inspired

you do the work of the devil, you got a million friends

they'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end

came along in a time of strife

i was under the gun, clouds blocking the sun

you changed my life



well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal

i do it myself, it's not so unreal

the call of the wild is forever at my door

wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor

came along in a time of strife

from silver and gold to what man cannot hold

you changed my life



i was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray

i was told i was looking good and to have a nice day

it all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite

eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet



but you changed my life

came along in a time of strife

from silver and gold to what man cannot hold

you changed my life



you were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm

while orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm

your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass

in the world you had made they made you an outcast



you changed my life

came along in a time of strife

from silver and gold to what man cannot hold

you changed my life



there was someone in my body that i could hardly see

invading my privacy making my decisions for me

holding me back, not letting me stand

making me feel like a stranger in a strange land



but you changed my life

came along in a time of strife

you come down the line, give me a new mind

you changed my life



my lord and my savior, my companion, my friend

heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end

1981,Shot of Love,Every Grain of Sand,"in the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need

when the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed

there’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere

toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair



don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake

like cain, i now behold this chain of events that i must break

in the fury of the moment i can see the master’s hand

in every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand



oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear

like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer

the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way

to ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay



i gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame

and every time i pass that way i always hear my name

then onward in my journey i come to understand

that every hair is numbered like every grain of sand



i have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night

in the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light

in the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space

in the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face



i hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea

sometimes i turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me

i am hanging in the balance of the reality of man

like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand"

1981,Shot of Love,In the Summertime,"i was in your presence for an hour or so

or was it a day i truly don’t know

where the sun never set, where the trees hung low

by that soft and shining sea

did you respect me for what i did

or for what i didn’t do, or for keeping it hid

did i lose my mind when i tried to get rid

of everything you see



in the summertime, ah in the summertime

in the summertime, when you were with me



i got the heart and you got the blood

we cut through iron and we cut through mud

then came the warnin’ that was before the flood

that set everybody free

fools they made a mock of sin

our loyalty they tried to win

but you were closer to me than my next of kin

when they didn’t want to know or see



in the summertime, ah in the summertime

in the summertime when you were with me



strangers, they meddled in our affairs

poverty and shame was theirs

but all that sufferin’ was not to be compared

with the glory that is to be

and i’m still carrying the gift you gave

it’s a part of me now, it’s been cherished and saved

it’ll be with me unto the grave

and then unto eternity

they said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules

few things you find are worthwhile

and though i don’t ask for much

no material things to touch

full of hope and desire

in a world that’s been raped and defiled

if i fall along the way

when all will be well

when god and man will be reconciled

but until men lose their chains

and righteousness reigns

to be seeing the real you at last



i’m hungry and i’m irritable

and i’m tired of this bag of tricks

at one time there was nothing wrong with me

that you could not fix



well, i sailed through the storm

strapped to the mast

but the time has come

and i’m seeing the real you at last



when i met you, baby

you didn’t show no visible scars

you could ride like annie oakley

you could shoot like belle starr

but all i care about now

is that i’m seeing the real you at last



well, i’m gonna quit this baby talk now

she lulled me to sleep

in a town without pity

where the water runs deep

she said, “be easy, baby

there ain’t nothin’ worth stealin’ in here”



you’re the one i’ve been looking for

you’re the one that’s got the key

but i can’t figure out whether i’m too good for you

or you’re too good for me



has anybody seen my love

has anybody seen my love

i don’t know

has anybody seen my love



well, they’re not showing any lights tonight

and there’s no moon

there’s just a hot-blooded singer

singing “memphis in june”

while they’re beatin’ the devil out of a guy

who’s wearing a powder-blue wig

later he’ll be shot

for resisting arrest

i can still hear his voice crying

in the wilderness

close up ain’t never that big

1985,Empire Burlesque,I’ll Remember You,"i’ll remember you

when i’ve forgotten all the rest

you to me were true

you to me were the best

when there is no more

you cut to the core

quicker than anyone i knew

when i’m all alone

in the great unknown

i’ll remember you



i’ll remember you

at the end of the trail

i had so much left to do

i had so little time to fail

there’s some people that

you don’t forget

even though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two

when the roses fade

and i’m in the shade

i’ll remember you



didn’t i, didn’t i try to love you

didn’t i, didn’t i try to care

didn’t i sleep, didn’t i weep beside you

with the rain blowing in your hair



i’ll remember you

when the wind blows through the piney wood

it was you who came right through

it was you who understood

though i’d never say

that i done it the way

that you’d have liked me to

in the end

i’ll remember you"
1985,Empire Burlesque,Dark Eyes,"oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside

they’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide

i live in another world where life and death are memorized

where the earth is strung with lovers’ pearls and all i see are dark eyes



a cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer

some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere

but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise

whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all i see are dark eyes



they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes

they tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, i’m sure it is

but i feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized

all i feel is heat and flame and all i see are dark eyes



oh, the french girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel

hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel

oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies

a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes"
1986,Knocked Out Loaded,Brownsville Girl,"well, there was this movie i seen one time

about a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred gregory peck

he was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself

the townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck



well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp

as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath

“turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square

i want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”



well, i keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in

and you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain

you know i can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart

the memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train



i can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert

in your busted down ford and your platform heels

i could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet

ah, but you were right. it was perfect as i got in behind the wheel



well, we drove that car all night into san anton’

and we slept near the alamo, your skin was so tender and soft

way down in mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back

i would have gone on after you but i didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off



well, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the rockies

now i know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul

but i’m too over the edge and i ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times

    when i was your only man

and she don’t want to remind me. she knows this car would go out of control



brownsville girl with your brownsville curls

teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

brownsville girl, show me all around the world

brownsville girl, you’re my honey love



well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards amarillo

we pulled up where henry porter used to live. he owned a wreckin’ lot

    outside of town about a mile

ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back.

    she saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust

she said, “henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”



then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of

    bummin’ a ride back to from where she started

but ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up

she said, “welcome to the land of the living dead”

    you could tell she was so broken hearted

she said, “even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”



“how far are y’all going” ruby asked us with a sigh

“we’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn

’til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”

ruby just smiled and said, “ah, you know some babies never learn”



something about that movie though, well i just can’t get it out of my head

but i can’t remember why i was in it or what part i was supposed to play

all i remember about it was gregory peck and the way people moved

and a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way



brownsville girl with your brownsville curls,

teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

brownsville girl, show me all around the world

brownsville girl, you’re my honey love



well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour

i was crossin’ the street when shots rang out

i didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so i ran

“we got him cornered in the churchyard,” i heard somebody shout



well, you saw my picture in the corpus christi tribune. underneath it,

    it said, “a man with no alibi”

you went out on a limb to testify for me, you said i was with you

then when i saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears

it was the best acting i saw anybody do



now i’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass

    but sometimes you just find yourself over the line

oh if there’s an original thought out there, i could use it right now

you know, i feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much.

    i could feel a whole lot better

if you were just here by my side to show me how



well, i’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring gregory peck

yeah, but you know it’s not the one that i had in mind

he’s got a new one out now, i don’t even know what it’s about

but i’ll see him in anything so i’ll stand in line



brownsville girl with your brownsville curls

teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

brownsville girl, show me all around the world

brownsville girl, you’re my honey love



you know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned

the only thing we knew for sure about henry porter

    is that his name wasn’t henry porter

and you know there was somethin’ about you baby that i liked

    that was always too good for this world

just like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked

    that i left behind in the french quarter



strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections

    than people who are most content

i don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when i’m gone

you always said people don’t do what they believe in,

    they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent

and i always said, “hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”



there was a movie i seen one time, i think i sat through it twice

i don’t remember who i was or where i was bound

all i remember about it was it starred gregory peck, he wore a gun

    and he was shot in the back

seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down

where the time and the tempo fly

and there’s no exit in any direction

’cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes

wasn’t making any great connection

wasn’t falling for any intricate scheme

nothing that would pass inspection

dreams where the umbrella is folded

into the path you are hurled

and the cards are no good that you’re holding

unless they’re from another world



in one, numbers were burning

in another, i witnessed a crime

you can tell me, i’m back

we can start it all over

get it back on the track

you got my attention

go ahead, speak

what was it you wanted

when you were kissing my cheek



was there somebody looking

when you give me that kiss

someone there in the shadows

someone that i might have missed

is there something you needed

something i don’t understand

what was it you wanted

do i have it here in my hand



whatever you wanted

slipped out of my mind

would you remind me again

if you’d be so kind

has the record been breaking

did the needle just skip

is there somebody waiting

was there a slip of the lip



what was it you wanted

i ain’t keeping score

are you the same person

that was here before

is it something important

maybe not

what was it you wanted

tell me again i forgot



whatever you wanted

what could it be

did somebody tell you

that you could get it from me

is it something that comes natural

is it easy to say

why do you want it

who are you anyway



is the scenery changing

am i getting it wrong

is the whole thing going backwards

are they playing our song

where were you when it started

do you want it for free

what was it you wanted

are you talking to me"
1989,Oh Mercy,Shooting Star,"seen a shooting star tonight

and i thought of you

you were trying to break into another world

a world i never knew

i always kind of wondered

if you ever made it through

seen a shooting star tonight

and i thought of you



seen a shooting star tonight

and i thought of me

if i was still the same

if i ever became what you wanted me to be

did i miss the mark or overstep the line

that only you could see

seen a shooting star tonight

and i thought of me



listen to the engine, listen to the bell

as the last fire truck from hell

goes rolling by

all good people are praying

it’s the last temptation, the last account

the last time you might hear the sermon on the mount

the last radio is playing



seen a shooting star tonight

slip away

tomorrow will be

another day

guess it’s too late to say the things to you

that you needed to hear me say

seen a shooting star tonight

slip away"
1990,Under the Red Sky,T.V. Talkin’ Song,"one time in london i’d gone out for a walk

past a place called hyde park where people talk

’bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view

to anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to



there was someone on a platform talking to the folks

about the t.v. god and all the pain that it invokes

“it’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes

if you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”



i moved in closer, got up on my toes

two men in front of me were coming to blows

the man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young

being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung



“the news of the day is on all the time

all the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme

your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free

don’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”



“pray for peace” he said. you could feel it in the crowd

my thoughts began to wander. his voice was ringing loud

“it will destroy your family, your happy home is gone

no one can protect you from it once you turn it on”



“it will lead you into some strange pursuits

lead you to the land of forbidden fruits

it will scramble up your head and drag your brain about

sometimes you gotta do like elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”



“it’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind

and when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find

every time you look at it, your situation’s worse

if you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse""



the crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man

there was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran

the t.v. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me

later on that evening, i watched it on t.v."

i must have made a few bad turns



i see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes

they’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes

all the young men with their young women looking so good

well, i’d trade places with any of them

in a minute, if i could



i’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog

talking to myself in a monologue

but it’s not like the sun that used to be

the party’s over and there’s less and less to say

i got new eyes

everything looks far away

over the hills and far away

there’s a way to get there and i’ll figure it out somehow

i’m stark naked, but i don’t care

i’m going off into the woods, i’m huntin’ bare

you don’t understand it—my feelings for you

well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew



i’m here to create the new imperial empire

i’m going to do whatever circumstances require

i care so much for you—didn’t think that i could

i can’t tell my heart that you’re no good

well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years

and i still got their advice oozing out of my ears

you don’t understand it—my feelings for you

through this weary world of woe

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

they say prayer has the power to help

so pray for me mother

in the human heart an evil spirit can dwell

i’m trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others

but oh, mother, things ain’t going well



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

i’ll burn that bridge before you can cross

they’ll be no mercy for you once you’ve lost



now i’m all worn down by weepin’

my eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry

if i catch my opponents ever sleepin’

i’ll just slaughter them where they lie



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

through a world mysterious and vague

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

walking through the cities of the plague



the whole world is filled with speculation

the whole wide world which people say is round

they will tear your mind away from contemplation

they will jump on your misfortune when you’re down



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

eatin’ hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

someday you’ll be glad to have me around



they will crush you with wealth and power

every waking moment you could crack

i’ll make the most of one last extra hour

i’ll avenge my father’s death then i’ll step back



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

hand me down my walkin’ cane

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

got to get you out of my miserable brain



it’s bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying

fame and honor never seem to fade

the fire’s gone out but the light is never dying

who says i can’t get heavenly aid



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

carrying a dead man’s shield

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

walkin’ with a toothache in my heel



the suffering is unending

every nook and cranny has its tears

i’m not playing, i’m not pretending

i’m not nursing any superfluous fears



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

walkin’ ever since the other night

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

walkin’ ’til i’m clean out of sight



as i walked out in the mystic garden

on a hot summer day, hot summer lawn

excuse me, ma’am, i beg your pardon

there’s no one here, the gardener is gone



ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

up the road around the bend

heart burnin’, still yearnin’

can’t explain

the sources of this hidden pain

you burned your way into my heart

you got the key to my brain

i’ve been trampling through mud

praying to the powers above

i’m sweating blood

you got a face that begs for love

life without you

doesn’t mean a thing to me

if i can’t have you

i’ll throw my love into the deep blue sea

sometimes i wonder

why you can’t treat me right

you do good all day

then you do wrong all night

i’m a thousand times happier than i could ever say

what does it matter

what price i pay

they brag about your sugar

brag about it all over town

put some sugar in my bowl

i’m pale as a ghost

holding a blossom on a stem

you ever seen a ghost no

but you have heard of them

i hear your name

ringing up and down the line

i’m saying it plain

these ties are strong enough to bind



i been in a brawl

now i’m feeling the wall

i’m going away baby

i won’t be back ’til fall

high on the hill

you can carry all my thoughts with you

you’ve numbed my will

this love could tear me in two

i wanna be with you in paradise

and it seems so unfair

i can’t go back to paradise no more

you think i’m past my prime

each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air

tomorrow keeps turning around

we live and we die, we know not why

but i'll be with you when the deal goes down



we eat and we drink, we feel and we think

far down the street we stray

i laugh and i cry and i'm haunted by

things i never meant nor wished to say

the midnight rain follows the train

we all wear the same thorny crown

soul to soul, our shadows roll

and i'll be with you when the deal goes down



the moon gives light and shines by night

i scarcely feel the glow

we learn to live and then we forgive

o'er the road we're bound to go

more frailer than the flowers, these precious hours

that keep us so tightly bound

you come to my eyes like a vision from the skies

and i'll be with you when the deal goes down



i picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes

i followed the winding stream

i heard a deafening noise, i felt transient joys

i know they're not what they seem

in this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain

you'll never see me frown

i owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true

and i'll be with you when the deal goes down"

2006,Modern Times,Workingman’s Blues #2,"there’s an evening’s haze settling over the town

starlight by the edge of the creek

the buying power of the proletariat’s gone down

money’s getting shallow and weak

the place i love best is a sweet memory

it’s a new path that we trod

they say low wages are a reality

if we want to compete abroad



my cruel weapons been laid back on the shelf

come and sit down on my knee

you are dearer to me than myself

as you yourself can see

i’m listening to the steel rails hum

got both eyes tight shut

i’m just trying to keep the hunger from

creepin’ its way into my gut



meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

bring me my boots and shoes

you can hang back or fight your best on the front line

sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues



i’m sailing on back getting ready for the long haul

leaving everything behind

if i stay here i’ll lose it all

the bandits will rob me blind

i’m trying to feed my soul with thought

gonna sleep off the rest of the day

sometimes nobody wants what you got

sometimes you can’t give it away



i woke up this morning and sprang to my feet

went into town on a whim

i saw my father there in the street

at least i think it was him

in the dark i hear the night birds call

the hills are rugged and steep

i sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall

if i told you my whole story you’d weep



meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

bring me my boots and shoes

you can hang back or fight your best on the front line

sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues



they burned my barn and they stole my horse

i can’t save a dime

it’s a long way down and i don’t want to be forced

into a life of continual crime

i can see for myself that the sun is sinking

o’er the banks of the deep blue sea

tell me, am i wrong in thinking

that you have forgotten me



now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret

they waste your nights and days

them, i will forget

you, i’ll remember always

it’s a cold black night and it’s midsummer’s eve

and the stars are spinning around

i still find it so hard to believe

that someone would kick me when i’m down



meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

bring me my boots and shoes

you can hang back or fight your best on the front line

sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues



i’ll be back home in a month or two

when the frost is on the vine

i’ll punch my spear right straight through

half-ways down your spine

i’ll lift up my arms to the starry skies

and pray the fugitive’s prayer

i’m guessing tomorrow the sun will rise

i hope the final judgment’s fair



the battle is over up in the hills

and the mist is closing in

look at me, with all of my spoils

what did i ever win

gotta brand new suit and a brand new wife

i can live on rice and beans

some people never worked a day in their life

they don’t know what work even means



meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

bring me my boots and shoes

you can hang back or fight your best on the front line sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues"

of an ancient town

petals from flowers

falling to the ground

beyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall

love waits forever, for one and for all



beyond the horizon, across the divide

’round about midnight, we’ll be on the same side

down in the valley the water runs cold

beyond the horizon someone’s prayin’ for your soul

in the dusk, in the dawn

i have to recover

get up and go on

beyond the horizon, beyond love’s burning game

every step that you take, i’m walking the same



beyond the horizon, the night winds blow

the theme of a melody from many moons ago

the bells of st. mary, how sweetly they chime

beyond the horizon i found you just in time

slipping and sliding

too late to stop

riding and gliding

beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue

you were the answer to my prayer



forgetful heart

we loved with all the love that life can give

what can i say

without you it's so hard to live

can't take much more

why can't we love like we did before



forgetful heart

like a walking shadow in my brain

all night long

i lay awake and listen to the sound of pain

the door has closed forevermore

if indeed there ever was a door"
2009,Together Through Life,Beyond Here Lies Nothin’,"i love you pretty baby

you're the only love i've ever known

just as long as you stay with me

the whole world is my throne

beyond here lies nothin'

nothin' we can call our own



i'm movin' after midnight

down boulevards of broken cars

don't know what i'd do without it

without this love that we call ours

beyond here lies nothin'

nothin' but the moon and stars



down every street there's a window

and every window made of glass

we'll keep on lovin' pretty baby

for as long as love will last

beyond here lies nothin'

but the mountains of the past



my ship is in the harbor

and the sails are spread

listen to me pretty baby

lay your hand upon my head

beyond here lies nothin'

nothin' done and nothin' said"

we strive for the same old ends

and i just can’t wait

wait for us to become friends

and they say that love is blind

if you want to live easy

ain’t no use in dreamin’

i got better things to do

dreams never worked anyway

even when they did come true

we see the meaning of life

in each other’s eyes

i feel a change coming on

and the fourth part of the day is already gone



i’m hearing billy joe shaver

and i’m reading james joyce

some people they tell me

i got the blood of the land in my voice

everybody got all the beautiful clothes

everybody got all the flowers

i feel a change coming on

and the fourth part of the day is already gone"

2012,Tempest,Tin Angel,"it was late last night when the boss came home

to a deserted mansion and a desolate throne

servant said, “boss, the lady’s gone

she left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”



“you got something to tell me, tell it to me, man.

come to the point as straight as you can.”

“old henry lee, chief of the clan,

came riding through the woods and took her by the hand.”



the boss he laid back flat on his bed

he cursed the heat and he clutched his head

he pondered the future of his fate

to wait another day would be far too late



""go fetch me my coat and my tie

and the cheapest labor that money can buy

saddle me up my buckskin mare

if you see me go by, put up a prayer.""



well, they rode all night and they rode all day

eastward long on the broad highway

his spirit was tired and his vision was bent

his men deserted him and onward he went



he came to a place where the light was dull

his forehead pounding in his skull

heavy heart was wracked with pain

insomnia raging in his brain



well he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword

he renounced his faith, he denied his lord

crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall

one way or another he'd put an end to it all



he leaned down, cut the electric wire

stared into the flames and he snorted the fire

peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two

it was hard to tell for certain who was who



he lowered himself down on a golden chain

his nerves were quaking in every vein

his knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air

he ran his fingers through his greasy hair



they looked at each other and their glasses clinked

one single unit inseparably linked

“got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”

“don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”



from behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor

he moved his feet and he bolted the door

shadows hiding the lines in his face

with all the nobility of an ancient race



she turned, she was startled with a look of surprise

with a hatred that could hit the skies

“you’re a reckless fool, i can see it in your eyes.

to come this way was by no means wise.”



“get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wench

and cover your face or suffer the consequence.

you are making my heart full sick.

put your clothes back on double quick.”



“silly boy, you think me a saint.

i’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.

you’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.

now hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”



“i’d have given you the stars and the planets too

but what good would these things do you

bow the heart, if not the knee

or never again this world you’ll see.”



“oh, please let not your heart be cold.

this man is dearer to me than gold.”

“oh my dear, you must be blind.

he’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”



“you had your way too long with me.

now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.

try to escape,” he cussed and cursed

“you’ll have to try to get past me first.”



“i dare not let your passion rule.

you think my heart, the heart of a fool.

and you sir, you cannot deny

you made a monkey of me, what and for why”



“i’ll have no more of this insulting chat.

the devil can have you, i’ll see to that.

look sharp or step aside,

or in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”



the gun went boom and the shot rang clear

first bullet grazed his ear

second ball went right straight in

and he bent in the middle like a twisted pin



he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head

he gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed

it would take more than needle and thread

bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead



“you shot my husband down, you fiend.”

“husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean

he was a man of strife, a man of sin.

i cut him down and i’ll throw him to the wind.”



“hear this,” she said, with angry breath

“you too shall meet the lord of death.

it was i who brought your soul to life.”

and she raised her robe and she drew out a knife



his face was hard and caked with sweat

his arms ached and his hands were wet

“you’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.

if you don’t mind, i’ll have the knife.”



“we’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.

but we’re no way similar in body and thought.

all husbands are good men, as all wives know.”

then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow



his knees went limp and he reached for the door

his doom was sealed, he slid to the floor

he whispered in her ear, “this is all your fault.

my fighting days have come to a halt.”



she touched his lip and kissed his cheek

he tried to speak, but his breath was weak

“you died for me, now i'll die for you.”

she put the blade to her heart and she ran it through



all three lovers together in a heap

thrown into the grave forever to sleep

funeral torches blazed away

through the towns and the villages all night and all day"
2012,Tempest,Tempest,"the pale moon rose in its glory

out on the western town

she told a sad, sad story

of the great ship that went down



‘twas the fourteen day of april

over the waves she rode

sailing into tomorrow

to a golden age foretold



the night was bright with starlight

the seas were sharp and clear

moving through the shadows

the promised hour was near



lights were holding steady

gliding over the foam

all the lords and ladies

heading for their eternal home



the chandeliers were swaying

from the balustrades above

the orchestra was playing

songs of faded love



the watchman he lay dreaming

as the ballroom dancers twirled

he dreamed the titanic was sinking

into the underworld



leo took his sketchbook

he was often so inclined

he closed his eyes and painted

the scenery in his mind



cupid struck his bosom

and broke it with a snap

the closest woman to him

he fell into her lap



he heard a loud commotion

something sounded wrong

his inner spirit was saying

that he couldn’t stand here long



he staggered to the quarterdeck

no time now to sleep

water on the quarterdeck

already three foot deep



smokestack leaning sideways

heavy feet began to pound

he walked into the whirlwind

sky spinning all around



the ship was going under

the universe opened wide

the roll was called up yonder

the angels turned aside



lights down in the hallway

flickering dim and dull

dead bodies already floating

in the double bottomed hull



the engines then exploded

propellers they failed to start

the boilers overloaded

the ship's bow split apart



passengers were flying

backward, forward, far and fast

they mumbled, fumbled, tumbled

each one more weary than the last



the veil was torn asunder

‘tween the hours of twelve and one

no change, no sudden wonder

could undo what had been done



the watchman lay there dreaming

at fourty-five degrees

he dreamed the titanic was sinking

dropping to her knees



wellington, he was sleeping

his bed began to slide

his valiant heart was beating

he pushed the tables aside



glass of shattered crystal

lay scattered ‘round about

he strapped on both his pistols

how long could he hold out



his men and his companions

were nowhere to be seen

in silence there he waited for

time and space to intervene



the passageway was narrow

there was blackness in the air

he saw every kind of sorrow

heard voices everywhere



alarm bells were ringing

to hold back the swelling tide

friends and lovers clinging

to each other side by side



mothers and their daughters

descending down the stairs

jumped into the icy waters

love and pity sent their prayers



the rich man, mr. astor

kissed his darling wife

he had no way of knowing

be the last trip of his life



calvin, blake and wilson

gambled in the dark

not one of them would ever live to

tell the tale of disembark



brother rose up against brother

in every circumstance

they fought and slaughtered each other

in a deadly dance



they lowered down the lifeboats

from the sinking wreck

there were traitors, there were turncoats

broken backs and broken necks



the bishop left his cabin

to help all those in need

turned his eyes up to the heavens

said, “the poor are yours to feed.”



davey the brothel keeper

came out, dismissed his girls

saw the water getting deeper

saw the changing of his world



jim dandy smiled

he'd never learned to swim

saw the little crippled child

and he gave his seat to him



he saw the starlight shining

streaming from the east

death was on the rampage

but his heart was now at peace



they battened down the hatches

but the hatches wouldn’t hold

they drowned upon the staircase

of brass and polished gold



leo said to cleo

“i think i’m going mad.”

but he'd lost his mind already

whatever mind he had



he tried to block the doorway

to save all those from harm

blood from an open wound

pouring down his arm



petals fell from flowers

‘til all of them were gone

in the long and dreadful hours

the wizard’s curse played on



the host was pouring brandy

he was going down slow

he stayed right ‘til the end

he was the last to go



there were many, many others

nameless here forevermore

they'd never sailed the ocean

or left their homes before



the watchman, he lay dreaming

the damage had been done

he dreamed the titanic was sinking

and he tried to tell someone



the captain, barely breathing

kneeling at the wheel

above him and beneath him

fifty thousand tons of steel



he looked over at his compass

and he gazed into its face

needle pointing downward

he knew he lost the race



in the dark illumination

he remembered bygone years

he read the book of revelation

and he filled his cup with tears



when the reaper’s task had ended

sixteen hundred had gone to rest

the good, the bad, the rich, the poor

the loveliest and the best



they waited at the landing

and they tried to understand

but there is no understanding

on the judgment of god’s hand



news came over the wires

and struck with deadly force

love had lost its fires

all things had run their course



the watchman he lay dreaming

of all things that can be

he dreamed the titanic was sinking

into the deep blue sea"

two trains running side by side

forty miles wide down the eastern line

you don’t have to go, i just came to you

we cried because our souls were torn

so much for tears

so much for those long and wasted years."

i painted my wagon - i abandoned all hope and i crossed the rubicon



the rubicon is the red river, going gently as she flows

redder then your ruby lips and the blood that flows from the rose

three miles north of purgatory - one step from the great beyond

i prayed to the cross and i kissed the girls and i crossed the rubicon



what are these dark days i see in this world so badly bent

how can i redeem the time - the time so idly spent

how much longer can it last - how long can this go on

i embraced my love put down my head and i crossed the rubicon



i feel the bones beneath my skin and they’re tremblin’ with rage

i’ll make your wife a widow - you’ll never see old age

show me one good man in sight that the sun shines down upon

i pawned my watch and i paid my debts and i crossed the rubicon



put my heart upon the hill where some happiness i’ll find

if i survive then let me love - let the hour be mine

take the high road - take the low, take the one you’re on

i poured the cup and i passed it along and i crossed the rubicon



you defiled the most lovely flower in all of womanhood

others can be tolerant - others can be good

i’ll cut you up with a crooked knife and i’ll miss you when you’re gone

i stood between heaven and earth and i crossed the rubicon



you won’t find any happiness here - no happiness or joy

go back to the gutter and try your luck - find you some nice young pretty boy

tell me how many men i need and who i can count upon

i strapped my belt and buttoned my coat and i crossed the rubicon



i feel the holy spirit inside and see the light that freedom gives

i believe it’s within the reach of every man who lives

keep as far away as possible - it’s darkest ‘fore the dawn

i turned the key and i broke it off and i crossed the rubicon



mona baby, are you still in my mind - i truly believe that you are

couldn’t be anybody else but you who’s come with me this far

the killing frost is on the ground and the autumn leaves are gone

i lit the torch and i looked to the east and i crossed the rubicon"
